In Proof‑of‑Stake (PoS), validators are chosen (often proportionally to the amount of stake they hold) to propose and attest to a new block, and their signatures are checked against the block’s hash and timestamp. Both mechanisms rely on the block’s cryptographic structure: the hash link guarantees that only a block with the correct previous‑hash, timestamp, and Merkle root can be accepted, while the consensus protocol ensures that the majority of honest participants agree on which valid block is appended, thus keeping the distributed ledger consistent and tamper‑evident.", "trajectory_id": "src_0003_86bff12b_traj_2", "reasoning_steps": [{"step": 1, "description": "Retrieve a conceptual overview of blockchain block structure using dense semantic search.", "intent": "Obtain core components of a block (hash linking, timestamp, transaction data, Merkle tree).", "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense", "observation": "Found that a blockchain is a growing list of records called \"blocks\" linked using cryptography.
