Early stopping rules have been employed in many different machine learning methods, with varying amounts of theoretical foundation. This section presents some of the basic machine-learning concepts required for a description of early stopping methods. Machine learning algorithms train a model based on a finite set of training data. During this training, the model is evaluated based on how well it predicts the observations contained in the training set.

Each LogitBoost invocation is warm-started from its results in the parent node. Finally, the tree is pruned. The basic LMT induction algorithm uses cross-validation to find a number of LogitBoost iterations that does not overfit the training data. A faster version has been proposed that uses the Akaike information criterion to control LogitBoost stopping. Logistic model tree In computer science, a logistic model tree (LMT) is a classification model with an associated supervised training algorithm that combines logistic regression (LR) and decision tree learning. Logistic model trees are based on the earlier idea of a\\n---\\n\\\"Cross-validation (statistics)\\\"\\nthe validation MSE under the assumption that the model specification is valid, cross-validation can be used for checking whether the model has been overfitted, in which case the MSE in the validation set will substantially exceed its anticipated value. (Cross-validation in the context of linear regression is also useful in that it can be used to select an optimally regularized cost function). In most other regression procedures (e.g. logistic regression), there is no simple formula to compute the expected out-of-sample fit. Cross-validation is, thus, a generally applicable way to predict the performance of a model on unavailable data using numerical\\n---\\n\\\"Early stopping\\\"\\nEarly stopping In machine learning, early stopping is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting when training a learner with an iterative method, such as gradient descent. Such methods update the learner so as to make it better fit the training data with each iteration. Up to a point, this improves the learner's performance on data outside of the training set. Past that point, however, improving the learner's fit to the training data comes at the expense of increased generalization error. Early stopping rules provide guidance as to how many iterations can be run before the learner begins to\\n---\\n\\\"Decision tree pruning\\\"\\nDecision tree pruning Pruning is a technique in machine learning that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances. Pruning reduces the complexity of the final classifier, and hence improves predictive accuracy by the reduction of overfitting. One of the questions that arises in a decision tree algorithm is the optimal size of the final tree. A tree that is too large risks overfitting the training data and poorly generalizing to new samples. A small tree might not capture important structural information about the sample space. However, it is\\n---\\n\\\"Regularization perspectives on support vector machines\\\"\\nto generalize without overfitting. SVM was first proposed in 1995 by Corinna Cortes and Vladimir Vapnik, and framed geometrically as a method for finding hyperplanes that can separate multidimensional data into two categories. This traditional geometric interpretation of SVMs provides useful intuition about how SVMs work, but is difficult to relate to other machine learning techniques for avoiding overfitting like regularization, early stopping, sparsity and Bayesian inference. However, once it was discovered that SVM is also a special case of Tikhonov regularization, regularization perspectives on SVM provided the theory necessary to fit SVM within a broader class of algorithms.
