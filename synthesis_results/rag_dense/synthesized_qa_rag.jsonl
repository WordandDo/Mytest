Patient monitoring and remote health tracking (e.g., wearable‑data analytics, ICU alert systems)\n4. Personalized/precision medicine (e.g., tailoring treatment plans to individual genetics and history)\n\n**Clinical decision‑support focused**\n5. Treatment planning and therapy recommendation (e.g., oncology radiotherapy planning, surgical assistance)\n6. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) that suggest interventions or flag risks during care delivery\n7. Predictive analytics for risk stratification and outcome forecasting\n\n**Research & development focused**\n8. Drug discovery and design (e.g., molecule screening, repurposing existing drugs)\n9.
