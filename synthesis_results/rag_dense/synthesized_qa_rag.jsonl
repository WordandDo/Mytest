{"question": "How do explicit regularization methods such as L1/L2 differ from early stopping in preventing overfitting, and what mechanisms underlie each approach?", "answer": "L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss that directly shrinks large weights, explicitly constraining model complexity, while early stopping halts training before the model fully fits the training data, implicitly limiting complexity by stopping the iterative learning process.
