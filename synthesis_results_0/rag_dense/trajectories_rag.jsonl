The emergence of AI technology in the radiology discipline is perceived as a threat by some specialists, as the technology can perform certain tasks better than human specialists, changing the role radiologists have currently. The increase of Telemedicine, has shown the rise of possible AI application. The ability to monitor patients using AI, may allow for the communication of information to physicians if possible disease activity may have occurred.

The subsequent motive of large based health companies merging with other health companies, allow for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data may allow for more implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems. As the amount of data increases, AI decision support systems become more efficient. Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the health care industry. The following are examples of large companies that\\n---\\n\\\"Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\\"\\nshown an increase in research regarding AI. However the specialty that has gained the greatest attention is the field of Radiology. Such an ability to interpret imaging results may allow clinicians to be aided to detect a change in an image that is minute in detail, or something that a clinician may have accidentally missed. Such a study that has incorporated AI in radiology is a study at Stanford which has results presenting that the algorithm that they created can detect Pneumonia better than radiologists.

The emergence of AI technology in the radiology discipline is perceived as a threat by some specialists, as the technology can perform certain tasks better than human specialists, changing the role radiologists have currently. The increase of Telemedicine, has shown the rise of possible AI application. The ability to monitor patients using AI, may allow for the communication of information to physicians if possible disease activity may have occurred. The use of a device such that a person may wear, may allow for constant monitoring of a patient and also for the\\n---\\n\\\"Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\\"\\nability to notice changes that may be less distinguishable by humans. The subsequent motive of large based health companies merging with other health companies, allow for greater health data accessibility. Greater health data may allow for more implementation of AI algorithms. A large part of industry focus of implementation of AI in the healthcare sector is in the clinical decision support systems. As the amount of data increases, AI decision support systems become more efficient. Numerous companies are exploring the possibilities of the incorporation of big data in the health care industry. The following are examples of large companies that\\n---\\n\\\"Artificial intelligence in healthcare\\\"\\nshown an increase in research regarding AI. However the specialty that has gained the greatest attention is the field of Radiology. Such an ability to interpret imaging results may allow clinicians to be aided to detect a change in an image that is minute in detail, or something that a clinician may have accidentally missed. Such a study that has incorporated AI in radiology is a study at Stanford which has results presenting that the algorithm that they created can detect Pneumonia better than radiologists. The radiology conference Radiological Society of North America has implemented a large part of its\\n---\\n\\\"Artificial intelligence\\\"\\nimmunosuppressant drugs to give to organ patients. Artificial intelligence is breaking into the healthcare industry by assisting doctors. According to Bloomberg Technology, Microsoft has developed AI to help doctors find the right treatments for cancer. There is a great amount of research and drugs developed relating to cancer. In detail, there are more than 800 medicines and vaccines to treat cancer.

Recent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data.
