There is some overlap with the history of machine translation and the history of artificial intelligence. The history of machine translation dates back to the seventeenth century, when philosophers such as Leibniz and Descartes put forward proposals for codes which would relate words between languages. All of these proposals remained theoretical, and none resulted in the development of an actual machine. The first patents for \\\"\\\"translating machines\\\"\\\" were applied for in the mid-1930s.

During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky. Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.

The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem. However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten-year-long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed. Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU,\\n---\\n\\\"Natural language processing\\\"\\nnatural language tasks, for example in language modeling, parsing, and many others. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing.

These occur in the natural language processing subfield of computer science and assign probabilities to given sequences of words by means of a probability distribution. Statistical language models are key components of speech recognition systems and of many machine translation systems: they tell such systems which possible output word sequences are probable and which are improbable.

Its main departure is the use of vector representations (\\\"\\\"embeddings\\\"\\\", \\\"\\\"continuous space representations\\\"\\\") for words and internal states. The structure of the models is simpler than phrase-based models. There is no separate language model, translation model, and reordering model, but just a single sequence model that predicts one word at a time. However, this sequence prediction is conditioned on the entire\\n---\\n\\\"Interactive fiction\\\"\\nan observer, rather than a direct participant. In some 'experimental' IF, the concept of self-identification is eliminated entirely, and the player instead takes the role of an inanimate object, a force of nature, or an abstract concept; experimental IF usually pushes the limits of the concept and challenges many assumptions about the medium. Though neither program was developed as a narrative work, the software programs ELIZA (1964\\u20131966) and SHRDLU (1968\\u20131970) can formally be considered early examples of interactive fiction, as both programs used natural language processing to take input from their user and respond in a virtual and conversational manner.\\n---\\n\\\"Cache language model\\\"\\ncaching results show that caching is by far the most useful technique for perplexity reduction at small and medium training data sizes\\\"\\\".

The construction of parsed corpora in the early 1990s revolutionized computational linguistics, which benefitted from large-scale empirical data. The exploitation of treebank data has been important ever since the first large-scale treebank, The Penn Treebank, was published. However, although originating in computational linguistics, the value of treebanks is becoming more widely appreciated in linguistics research as a whole. For example, annotated treebank data has been crucial in syntactic research to test linguistic theories of sentence structure against large quantities of naturally occurring examples.\\n---\\nTreebank\\nmain groups can be distinguished: treebanks that annotate phrase structure (for example the Penn Treebank or ICE-GB) and those that annotate dependency structure (for example the Prague Dependency Treebank or the Quranic Arabic Dependency Treebank). It is important to clarify the distinction between the formal representation and the file format used to store the annotated data. Treebanks are necessarily constructed according to a particular grammar. The same grammar may be implemented by different file formats. For example, the syntactic analysis for \\\"\\\"John loves Mary\\\"\\\", shown in the figure on the right, may be represented by simple labelled brackets in a\\n---\\nTreebank\\ntext file, like this (following the Penn Treebank notation): This type of representation is popular because it is light on resources, and the tree structure is relatively easy to read without software tools. However, as corpora become increasingly complex, other file formats may be preferred. Alternatives include treebank-specific XML schemes, numbered indentation and various types of standoff notation. From a computational perspective, treebanks have been used to engineer state-of-the-art natural language processing systems such as part-of-speech taggers, parsers, semantic analyzers and machine translation systems.

Early stopping rules have been employed in many different machine learning methods, with varying amounts of theoretical foundation. This section presents some of the basic machine-learning concepts required for a description of early stopping methods. Machine learning algorithms train a model based on a finite set of training data. During this training, the model is evaluated based on how well it predicts the observations contained in the training set. In general, however, the goal of a machine learning scheme is to produce a model that generalizes, that is, that predicts previously unseen observations. Overfitting occurs when a model fits\\n---\\n\\\"Early stopping\\\"\\nthe data in the training set well, while incurring larger generalization error. Regularization, in the context of machine learning, refers to the process of modifying a learning algorithm so as to prevent overfitting. This generally involves imposing some sort of smoothness constraint on the learned model. This smoothness may be enforced explicitly, by fixing the number of parameters in the model, or by augmenting the cost function as in Tikhonov regularization. Tikhonov regularization, along with principal component regression and many other regularization schemes, fall under the umbrella of spectral regularization, regularization characterized by the application of a filter.

Since the degree of model overfitting is determined by both its power and the amount of training it receives, providing a convolutional network with more training examples can reduce overfitting. Since these networks are usually trained with all available data, one approach is to either generate new data from scratch (if possible) or perturb existing data to create new ones. For example, input images could be asymmetrically cropped by a few percent to create new examples with the same label as the original. One of the simplest methods to prevent overfitting of a network is to simply stop the\\n---\\nOverfitting\\nhow many parameters exist in each model; the expressivity of each parameter must be considered as well. For example, it is nontrivial to directly compare the complexity of a neural net (which can track curvilinear relationships) with parameters to a regression model with parameters. Overfitting is especially likely in cases where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, causing the learner to adjust to very specific random features of the training data, that have no causal relation to the target function.

It comes with the disadvantage that the learning process is halted. Another simple way to prevent overfitting is to limit the number of parameters, typically by limiting the number of hidden units in each layer or limiting network depth. For convolutional networks, the filter size also affects the number of parameters. Limiting the number of parameters restricts the predictive power of the network directly, reducing the complexity of the function that it can perform on the data, and thus limits the amount of overfitting.

This smoothness may be enforced explicitly, by fixing the number of parameters in the model, or by augmenting the cost function as in Tikhonov regularization.

For example, a model might be selected by maximizing its performance on some set\"}", "intent": "Retrieve conceptual information on cross-validation and its role in detecting overfitting in machine learning, using semantic search to capture relevant explanations and methods.", "action": {"tool_name": "query_knowledge_base_dense", "parameters": {"query": "cross-validation detecting overfitting in machine learning", "top_k": "5", "worker_id": "worker-3"}}, "parent_id": "d4_t20_b0", "children_ids": ["d6_t22_b0"], "depth": 5}, {"node_id": "d6_t22_b0", "observation": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"results\": \"Overfitting\\nOverfitting In statistics, overfitting is \\\"\\\"the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably\\\"\\\". An overfitted model is a statistical model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. The essence of overfitting is to have unknowingly extracted some of the residual variation (i.e. the noise) as if that variation represented underlying model structure. Underfitting occurs when a statistical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. An underfitted model is a model where\\n---\\nOverfitting\\nselection, argue that to avoid overfitting, we should adhere to the \\\"\\\"Principle of Parsimony\\\"\\\". The authors also state the following. Overfitting is more likely to be a serious concern when there is little theory available to guide the analysis, in part because then there tend to be a large number of models to select from. The book \\\"\\\"Model Selection and Model Averaging\\\"\\\" (2008) puts it this way. In regression analysis, overfitting occurs frequently. As an extreme example, if there are \\\"\\\"p\\\"\\\" variables in a linear regression with \\\"\\\"p\\\"\\\" data points, the fitted line can go exactly through every point. A\\n---\\nOverfitting\\nstatistical model or machine learning algorithm cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. It occurs when the model or algorithm does not fit the data enough. Underfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low variance but high bias (to contrast the opposite, overfitting from high variance and low bias). It is often a result of an excessively simple model. Burnham & Anderson state the following.

A weak test suite may cause generate-and-validate techniques to produce validated but incorrect patches that have negative effects such as eliminating desirable functionalities, causing memory leaks, and introducing security vulnerabilities. Sometimes, in test-suite based program repair, tools generate patches that pass the test suite, yet are actually incorrect, this is known as the \\\"\\\"overfitting\\\"\\\" problem. \\\"\\\"Overfitting\\\"\\\" in this context refers to the fact that the patch overfits to the test inputs.

However, choosing larger shapes will dramatically reduce the dimension of the signal, and may result in excess information loss. Often, non-overlapping pooling windows perform best. Regularization is a process of introducing additional information to solve an ill-posed problem or to prevent overfitting. CNNs use various types of regularization. Because a fully connected layer occupies most of the parameters, it is prone to overfitting.
