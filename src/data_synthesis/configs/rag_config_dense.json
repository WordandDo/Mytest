    "question": "An inventor filed a patent the same year a transcontinental railway was completed. He worked at the second-largest company in its sector, founded by someone who studied at an institution established three decades after a political reformation. The founder's mentor had one successful project that influenced a technological standard adopted by a consortium formed between a treaty and a conflict. The patent was reviewed by five experts; only two never held executive positions at bankrupt companies. Of these two, only one completed their degree faster than the median time, published research later cited by the inventor, and never received the triennial professional society honors. This expert's research built on work from the third laboratory at a university renamed for a benefactor whose wealth came from an industry at a two-decade merger peak. The patent improved efficiency more than the industry average but less than the theoretical maximum calculated by an institute funded by a foundation established by one of seven siblings who didn't join the family business. The institute's founding director ranked fifth in a class of 43 students. The patent was filed seven years after the expert's degree completion, two years before the foundation's largest donation, and when the inventor's company was acquired in Q4 (one of four sector acquisitions that quarter, but the only one where the founder stayed as advisor). The inventor was the only company employee who worked on the standard-influencing project, was cited by the reviewing expert, and whose patent's efficiency fell in the specified range. What is this inventor's family name?",
    "answer": "Westinghouse"

    "question": "A cultural achievement was created between two political events: a succession crisis during a military campaign (opposed by a council from territories acquired through three generations of strategic marriages, initiated by trade disruptions from a distant natural disaster), and a conflict ending in a year divisible by 11. The creator was one of five prominent artists; three worked for religious patrons, but this one never did. Of the two secular artists, only one trained outside the traditional artisan quarter. Their master was the second of three sons (the only one not inheriting property) who studied in exactly four cities. Materials cost over fifty times a craftsman's annual income, sourced from the third-largest global producer, procured by a merchant family ranked 5th-10th wealthiest who rose from outside top 20 in one generation after a banking crisis eliminated seven dominant firms. Three factors enabled creation: knowledge from craftsmen migrating after a dynasty collapse (ruling twice as long as the later conflict), patronage from a family financing a six-state alliance during the succession crisis, and scholars from an institution reformed after receiving an endowment from a manufacturing monopoly holder. Such works were produced at two per decade in peace, dropping by half in conflict. This was created in a transitional year with three total works, but it's the only one never relocated from its original location. What is this achievement's name?",
    "answer": "School of Athens"

    "question": "A scientific discovery was announced from an institution in a city that became the national capital exactly one century before the discovery. This was the third institution in that field in the city but the first to receive government funding after reforms between two election cycles. The lead researcher was one of four scientists with similar backgrounds; three had advisors who won major prizes, but this researcher's advisor was nominated exactly twice but never won. The researcher completed training longer than the minimum but less than the international student average, never published in the field's most prestigious journal before this, but was the only one immediately replicated by three independent groups. The discovery resolved an inconsistency persisting for a duration equal to the gap between two paradigm shifts, originally identified by a theorist ranked 6th-10th most-cited who worked at six institutions. The theoretical framework involved researchers from at least eight countries. Specialized equipment became available after a breakthrough in a prime-numbered year, developed by a company formed from merging three firms. When published, the journal ranked 5th-7th by impact. The discovery received a major prize exactly two years after publication. The year must be: one century after the city became capital, within the decade when all eight countries were politically stable, three years after equipment became commercially available, and two years before the prize. In what year was this announced?",
    "answer": "1953"

  "sampling_tips": "Exploration Strategy (Dense RAG / Curiosity-Driven Mapping):\n\n=== KEY SHIFT (CRUCIAL) ===\nYou are NOT solving a single predefined question. The seed is a TOPIC, not a query to answer.\nYour job is to maximize reusable evidence for later QA synthesis.\n\n=== TWO-PHASE MINDSET ===\n- Phase 1 (YOU now, exploration): collect facts, entities, relations, and precise constraints as widely as possible.\n- Phase 2 (later, synthesis): select a subset of collected evidence to build multi-hop reasoning questions.\nTherefore: DO NOT converge early, and DO NOT optimize for a single answer.\n\n=== PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ===\nCreate a broad, connected evidence graph with multiple clusters and many potential cross-links.\n\n=== HARD RULES (MUST) ===\n1) Anti-goal-seeking: Do NOT lock onto one target answer. Even if a simple Q is already answerable, keep exploring other branches.\n2) No redundancy: NEVER repeat the same query or trivial rephrases. Each step must add NEW information.\n3) Breadth quota first: obtain >=5 distinct entity clusters before deep-diving (examples: people, organizations, places, standards/specs, products/projects, timeline events).\n4) Frontier rotation: keep a running frontier list of discovered entities/terms; every 1-2 steps, pivot to a NEW frontier item.\n5) Graph growth: each step introduces a new entity OR a new relation edge (ideally both). Add bridge edges regularly.\n6) Evidence-only: treat retrieval text as the only truth; do NOT fill gaps with your own knowledge.\n7) Intent wording constraint: NEVER write intents like 'to answer the question'. Write intents as exploration moves (map/expand/bridge/contrast).\n\n=== EXPLORATION PLAYBOOK (ROTATE THESE MOVES) ===\nA) Map the space (breadth)\n- What is X? What are its aliases/abbreviations? What subtopics surround it?\nB) Harvest entities (who/what/where)\n- List key organizations/people/standards/projects/places related to X.\nC) Harvest relations (how things connect)\n- How is A related to B? Who founded/maintains/standardizes/publishes A? What is A part of?\nD) Harvest constraints (numbers/dates)\n- Retrieve exact years, counts, locations, version numbers, thresholds.\nE) Contrast & disambiguate\n- Differences between X and Y; common confusions; similar terms.\nF) Bridge clusters (connector queries)\n- Use entity names from different clusters in one query to force linking.\n\n=== QUERY FORMULATION (Dense) ===\n- Use descriptive, context-rich natural language sentences (not keywords).\n- Use bilingual terms when helpful (original term + English paraphrase) to match KB phrasing.\n- Use top_k strategically: mapping (top_k=10-15), targeted confirmation (top_k=5-8).\n\n=== INTENT FIELD (WHAT TO WRITE) ===\nWrite the intent as an exploration move and expected novelty, e.g.:\n- 'Map aliases and nearby subtopics of X to expand frontier'\n- 'Introduce a new cluster: standards/specifications connected to X'\n- 'Bridge two clusters by retrieving the relationship between A and B'\n",
  "synthesis_tips": "QA Synthesis Guidance (Multi-hop, Evidence-Selection, Retrieval-grounded):\n\n=== CONTEXT (IMPORTANT) ===\nThe exploration phase is intentionally broad and may include multiple clusters/subtopics. Your job is to SELECT a coherent, high-signal evidence subset and build a multi-hop question from it.\n\n=== CORE REQUIREMENTS (MUST) ===\n1) Multi-hop reasoning: The question MUST require combining evidence from multiple retrieval steps.\n   - Target: >=4 reasoning steps AND cite >=3 distinct trajectory observations.\n2) Retrieval-only: Use ONLY facts explicitly present in the trajectory observations. Do NOT use background/common knowledge.\n3) Verifiable single-fact answer: The answer should be a short phrase (name/date/number/location/boolean) directly supported by cited excerpts.\n4) Evidence citations: Every reasoning step MUST include a verbatim excerpt copied from the observation text (no paraphrased evidence).\n5) No guessing: If the trajectory lacks enough evidence for a multi-hop question, craft a different question whose answer is fully supported by existing observations.\n\n=== EVIDENCE SELECTION PROCEDURE (DO THIS) ===\n- First, scan the trajectory and identify recurring entities/relations that appear across multiple observations.\n- Select 3-6 observations that form a connected chain (A->B->C) or an intersection (constraints from different observations converge on one answer).\n- Prefer using evidence from non-adjacent steps when possible, so the question is truly multi-hop.\n- Ensure the answer cannot be obtained from any single observation alone.\n\n=== HOW TO MAKE IT MULTI-HOP ===\nChoose a structure that forces joins across evidence:\n- Bridge chain: A -> relation -> B -> attribute -> C -> target fact\n- Intersection: identify the only entity satisfying constraints from different observations\n- Temporal/causal chain: derive ordering or dependency using multiple statements\n- Aggregation: count/sum items satisfying conditions across observations\n- Disambiguation: choose the correct entity among similar candidates using multiple constraints\n\n=== ANTI-PATTERNS (AVOID) ===\n- Single-hop definition/translation questions\n- Questions answerable by one snippet alone\n- Answers not explicitly supported by quoted evidence\n\n=== OUTPUT QUALITY ===\n- It is OK to ignore irrelevant/noisy exploration steps; use the most connected, high-signal subset.\n- Keep the question concise but constraint-rich (no story).",
