    "question": "An inventor filed a patent the same year a transcontinental railway was completed. He worked at the second-largest company in its sector, founded by someone who studied at an institution established three decades after a political reformation. The founder's mentor had one successful project that influenced a technological standard adopted by a consortium formed between a treaty and a conflict. The patent was reviewed by five experts; only two never held executive positions at bankrupt companies. Of these two, only one completed their degree faster than the median time, published research later cited by the inventor, and never received the triennial professional society honors. This expert's research built on work from the third laboratory at a university renamed for a benefactor whose wealth came from an industry at a two-decade merger peak. The patent improved efficiency more than the industry average but less than the theoretical maximum calculated by an institute funded by a foundation established by one of seven siblings who didn't join the family business. The institute's founding director ranked fifth in a class of 43 students. The patent was filed seven years after the expert's degree completion, two years before the foundation's largest donation, and when the inventor's company was acquired in Q4 (one of four sector acquisitions that quarter, but the only one where the founder stayed as advisor). The inventor was the only company employee who worked on the standard-influencing project, was cited by the reviewing expert, and whose patent's efficiency fell in the specified range. What is this inventor's family name?",
    "answer": "Westinghouse"

    "question": "A cultural achievement was created between two political events: a succession crisis during a military campaign (opposed by a council from territories acquired through three generations of strategic marriages, initiated by trade disruptions from a distant natural disaster), and a conflict ending in a year divisible by 11. The creator was one of five prominent artists; three worked for religious patrons, but this one never did. Of the two secular artists, only one trained outside the traditional artisan quarter. Their master was the second of three sons (the only one not inheriting property) who studied in exactly four cities. Materials cost over fifty times a craftsman's annual income, sourced from the third-largest global producer, procured by a merchant family ranked 5th-10th wealthiest who rose from outside top 20 in one generation after a banking crisis eliminated seven dominant firms. Three factors enabled creation: knowledge from craftsmen migrating after a dynasty collapse (ruling twice as long as the later conflict), patronage from a family financing a six-state alliance during the succession crisis, and scholars from an institution reformed after receiving an endowment from a manufacturing monopoly holder. Such works were produced at two per decade in peace, dropping by half in conflict. This was created in a transitional year with three total works, but it's the only one never relocated from its original location. What is this achievement's name?",
    "answer": "School of Athens"

    "question": "A scientific discovery was announced from an institution in a city that became the national capital exactly one century before the discovery. This was the third institution in that field in the city but the first to receive government funding after reforms between two election cycles. The lead researcher was one of four scientists with similar backgrounds; three had advisors who won major prizes, but this researcher's advisor was nominated exactly twice but never won. The researcher completed training longer than the minimum but less than the international student average, never published in the field's most prestigious journal before this, but was the only one immediately replicated by three independent groups. The discovery resolved an inconsistency persisting for a duration equal to the gap between two paradigm shifts, originally identified by a theorist ranked 6th-10th most-cited who worked at six institutions. The theoretical framework involved researchers from at least eight countries. Specialized equipment became available after a breakthrough in a prime-numbered year, developed by a company formed from merging three firms. When published, the journal ranked 5th-7th by impact. The discovery received a major prize exactly two years after publication. The year must be: one century after the city became capital, within the decade when all eight countries were politically stable, three years after equipment became commercially available, and two years before the prize. In what year was this announced?",
    "answer": "1953"

  "sampling_tips": "Trajectory Exploration Strategy:\n\n=== OBJECTIVE ===\nCreate diverse, information-rich exploration trajectories that enable complex multi-hop reasoning questions with adversarial complexity. Each exploration step should contribute unique information that interconnects with other steps.\n\n=== CORE STRATEGIES ===\n\n1. AVOID DUPLICATE INFORMATION\n   - Do NOT search for the same information multiple times\n   - Do NOT revisit entities or relationships already explored\n   - Maximize information diversity across the trajectory\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: Search \"Steve Jobs biography\" → Learn about Apple founding\n   Step 2: Search \"Apple Inc founding history\" → Discover Steve Wozniak's role\n   Step 3: Search \"Steve Wozniak early projects\" → Find Homebrew Computer Club\n   Benefit: Each step expands into new territory with connected but distinct information\n\n2. EXPLORE ENTITIES & RELATIONSHIPS (Not Just Attributes)\n   - Prioritize discovering NEW entities connected to current entities\n   - Focus on exploring RELATIONSHIPS between entities rather than collecting attributes\n   - Build a rich relationship graph, not an attribute list\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example (Entity & Relationship-focused):\n   Seed: \"Tesla Inc\"\n   Step 1: Search \"Tesla Inc founders\" → Discover Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning\n   Step 2: Search \"Martin Eberhard previous companies\" → Discover NuvoMedia and Rocket eBook\n   Step 3: Search \"NuvoMedia acquisition\" → Discover acquired by Gemstar in 2000\n   Benefit: Creates chain of connected entities: Tesla → Eberhard → NuvoMedia → Gemstar\n\n3. EXPLORE SIMILAR ENTITIES FOR DISAMBIGUATION\n   - When discovering an entity, search for similar entities (same name, similar role, same time period)\n   - Collect distinguishing features that enable fine-grained differentiation\n   - Create disambiguation scenarios requiring multiple constraints\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: Search \"John Williams composer\" → Find famous film composer\n   Step 2: Search \"other composers named John Williams\" → Discover classical guitarist John Williams\n   Step 3: Explore specific works, birth years, awards of each\n   Benefit: Creates disambiguation challenge requiring multiple identifying features\n\n4. EXPLORE TEMPORAL INFORMATION\n   - Collect precise dates, time periods, durations, and temporal relationships\n   - Focus on relative timing (before/after/during), overlaps, and sequences\n   - Explore event durations and time gaps between events\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"iPhone launch date\" → January 2007\n   Step 2: \"iPhone development timeline\" → Started 2004, announced 2007\n   Step 3: \"Competitor smartphones 2004-2007\" → BlackBerry peak, Nokia dominance\n   Benefit: Enables temporal reasoning questions about sequences and windows\n\n5. COLLECT QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION\n   - Gather numerical data: counts, rankings, measurements, statistics\n   - Explore comparisons and relative quantities\n   - Record ordinal information (first, second, largest, etc.)\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"SpaceX funding rounds\" → Series A $20M (2008), Series B $50M (2009)\n   Step 2: \"SpaceX employee growth\" → 100 (2005) → 1000 (2010) → 10000 (2020)\n   Benefit: Enables quantitative reasoning and ranking questions\n\n6. EXPLORE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS\n   - Focus on cause-effect relationships, influences, and dependencies\n   - Explore contributing factors and consequences\n   - Identify multi-factor causality chains\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"Nokia market decline causes\" → iPhone disruption, slow to adapt\n   Step 2: \"Nokia smartphone strategy 2007-2010\" → Symbian OS limitations\n   Step 3: \"Nokia Microsoft partnership\" → Result of declining market share\n   Benefit: Creates causal reasoning chains for complex questions\n\n7. EXPLORE NEGATIVE AND EXCLUSION INFORMATION\n   - Collect information about what did NOT happen or what entities lack\n   - Explore exclusions, exceptions, and contrasts\n   - Document entities that were considered but rejected\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"Apple acquisition attempts\" → Tried to acquire Dropbox (declined)\n   Step 2: \"Companies Apple did not acquire\" → Rejected partnerships\n   Benefit: Enables negation-based reasoning questions\n\n=== QUALITY CHECKLIST ===\n✓ Did I explore at least 3 distinct entities?\n✓ Did I collect temporal information (dates, durations, sequences)?\n✓ Did I gather quantitative data (numbers, rankings, counts)?\n✓ Did I explore causal relationships and dependencies?\n✓ Did I find similar entities for disambiguation scenarios?\n✓ Did I collect both positive facts and negative/exclusion information?\n✓ Can these discoveries form complex reasoning chains with temporal, quantitative, and causal elements?",
  "synthesis_tips": "QA Synthesis Guidelines (Depth-First, Low-Entrance):\n\n=== PRIMARY GOAL ===\nGenerate questions with FEW surface clues but DEEP multi-hop reasoning. Avoid dumping a long list of trivia.\n\n=== HARD CONSTRAINTS (MUST) ===\n\n1) NO ANSWER LEAKAGE / NO TRIVIAL SHORTCUTS\n   - The answer text MUST NOT appear verbatim in the question.\n   - Do NOT state the asked attribute in a direct definitional clause.\n     Example of forbidden shortcut: If asking for an aircraft's 'type/role', do NOT write '...developed for aerial reconnaissance...' and then ask 'what type/role was it?'.\n   - No single clue (or any 1-hop lookup) should be sufficient. Solving MUST require combining >=3 independent constraints.\n\n2) LOW-ENTRANCE, HIGH-DEPTH REASONING SHAPE\n   - Limit the question to 2–4 top-level clues (2 sentences max). Each clue must meaningfully prune candidates.\n   - Target reasoning depth >=6 hops, with at least 2 converging subchains (a narrow DAG, not a wide list).\n   - Prefer depth-first chains (A→B→C→D→...) plus 1–2 side constraints for disambiguation.\n\n3) USE TRAJECTORY EVIDENCE, BUT COMPRESS IT\n   - You may use the trajectory broadly for reasoning, but do NOT copy/paste every discovered detail into the question.\n   - Merge multiple raw facts into a single higher-level constraint when possible.\n   - Every included clue must be grounded in the trajectory; do not inject external knowledge.\n\n4) COMPLEXITY REQUIREMENTS (USE AT LEAST TWO)\n   - Adversarial disambiguation among similar entities\n   - Temporal window / duration / ordering reasoning\n   - Quantitative comparison / ranking / thresholds\n   - Negation / exclusion constraints\n   - Multi-factor causality\n   - Implicit premise inference (answer not explicitly stated as a single sentence)\n\n5) UNDERLYING GRAPH COMPLEXITY (NOT VERBOSITY)\n   - The underlying reasoning graph should have >=10 nodes and >=10 edges across the full reasoning process.\n   - Important: This does NOT mean you should list 10+ facts in the question. Keep the question compact; depth comes from reasoning, not enumeration.\n\n=== CONCISENESS RULES ===\n- Question: <=2 sentences, no storytelling, no filler.\n- Answer: a short phrase (name/date/number/short NP). Avoid full explanatory sentences.\n\n=== SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING ===\n✓ If removing any one clue does NOT change the candidate set, that clue is redundant—remove it.\n✓ If the question can be answered from the first sentence alone, it has a shortcut—regenerate.\n✓ Ensure the answer cannot be obtained from a single observation snippet; it should require combining evidence from multiple trajectory steps.",
