    "question": "An inventor filed a patent the same year a transcontinental railway was completed. He worked at the second-largest company in its sector, founded by someone who studied at an institution established three decades after a political reformation. The founder's mentor had one successful project that influenced a technological standard adopted by a consortium formed between a treaty and a conflict. The patent was reviewed by five experts; only two never held executive positions at bankrupt companies. Of these two, only one completed their degree faster than the median time, published research later cited by the inventor, and never received the triennial professional society honors. This expert's research built on work from the third laboratory at a university renamed for a benefactor whose wealth came from an industry at a two-decade merger peak. The patent improved efficiency more than the industry average but less than the theoretical maximum calculated by an institute funded by a foundation established by one of seven siblings who didn't join the family business. The institute's founding director ranked fifth in a class of 43 students. The patent was filed seven years after the expert's degree completion, two years before the foundation's largest donation, and when the inventor's company was acquired in Q4 (one of four sector acquisitions that quarter, but the only one where the founder stayed as advisor). The inventor was the only company employee who worked on the standard-influencing project, was cited by the reviewing expert, and whose patent's efficiency fell in the specified range. What is this inventor's family name?",
    "answer": "Westinghouse"

    "question": "A cultural achievement was created between two political events: a succession crisis during a military campaign (opposed by a council from territories acquired through three generations of strategic marriages, initiated by trade disruptions from a distant natural disaster), and a conflict ending in a year divisible by 11. The creator was one of five prominent artists; three worked for religious patrons, but this one never did. Of the two secular artists, only one trained outside the traditional artisan quarter. Their master was the second of three sons (the only one not inheriting property) who studied in exactly four cities. Materials cost over fifty times a craftsman's annual income, sourced from the third-largest global producer, procured by a merchant family ranked 5th-10th wealthiest who rose from outside top 20 in one generation after a banking crisis eliminated seven dominant firms. Three factors enabled creation: knowledge from craftsmen migrating after a dynasty collapse (ruling twice as long as the later conflict), patronage from a family financing a six-state alliance during the succession crisis, and scholars from an institution reformed after receiving an endowment from a manufacturing monopoly holder. Such works were produced at two per decade in peace, dropping by half in conflict. This was created in a transitional year with three total works, but it's the only one never relocated from its original location. What is this achievement's name?",
    "answer": "School of Athens"

    "question": "A scientific discovery was announced from an institution in a city that became the national capital exactly one century before the discovery. This was the third institution in that field in the city but the first to receive government funding after reforms between two election cycles. The lead researcher was one of four scientists with similar backgrounds; three had advisors who won major prizes, but this researcher's advisor was nominated exactly twice but never won. The researcher completed training longer than the minimum but less than the international student average, never published in the field's most prestigious journal before this, but was the only one immediately replicated by three independent groups. The discovery resolved an inconsistency persisting for a duration equal to the gap between two paradigm shifts, originally identified by a theorist ranked 6th-10th most-cited who worked at six institutions. The theoretical framework involved researchers from at least eight countries. Specialized equipment became available after a breakthrough in a prime-numbered year, developed by a company formed from merging three firms. When published, the journal ranked 5th-7th by impact. The discovery received a major prize exactly two years after publication. The year must be: one century after the city became capital, within the decade when all eight countries were politically stable, three years after equipment became commercially available, and two years before the prize. In what year was this announced?",
    "answer": "1953"

  "sampling_tips": "Trajectory Exploration Strategy:\n\n=== OBJECTIVE ===\nCreate diverse, information-rich exploration trajectories that enable complex multi-hop reasoning questions with adversarial complexity. Each exploration step should contribute unique information that interconnects with other steps.\n\n=== CORE STRATEGIES ===\n\n1. AVOID DUPLICATE INFORMATION\n   - Do NOT search for the same information multiple times\n   - Do NOT revisit entities or relationships already explored\n   - Maximize information diversity across the trajectory\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: Search \"Steve Jobs biography\" → Learn about Apple founding\n   Step 2: Search \"Apple Inc founding history\" → Discover Steve Wozniak's role\n   Step 3: Search \"Steve Wozniak early projects\" → Find Homebrew Computer Club\n   Benefit: Each step expands into new territory with connected but distinct information\n\n2. EXPLORE ENTITIES & RELATIONSHIPS (Not Just Attributes)\n   - Prioritize discovering NEW entities connected to current entities\n   - Focus on exploring RELATIONSHIPS between entities rather than collecting attributes\n   - Build a rich relationship graph, not an attribute list\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example (Entity & Relationship-focused):\n   Seed: \"Tesla Inc\"\n   Step 1: Search \"Tesla Inc founders\" → Discover Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning\n   Step 2: Search \"Martin Eberhard previous companies\" → Discover NuvoMedia and Rocket eBook\n   Step 3: Search \"NuvoMedia acquisition\" → Discover acquired by Gemstar in 2000\n   Benefit: Creates chain of connected entities: Tesla → Eberhard → NuvoMedia → Gemstar\n\n3. EXPLORE SIMILAR ENTITIES FOR DISAMBIGUATION\n   - When discovering an entity, search for similar entities (same name, similar role, same time period)\n   - Collect distinguishing features that enable fine-grained differentiation\n   - Create disambiguation scenarios requiring multiple constraints\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: Search \"John Williams composer\" → Find famous film composer\n   Step 2: Search \"other composers named John Williams\" → Discover classical guitarist John Williams\n   Step 3: Explore specific works, birth years, awards of each\n   Benefit: Creates disambiguation challenge requiring multiple identifying features\n\n4. EXPLORE TEMPORAL INFORMATION\n   - Collect precise dates, time periods, durations, and temporal relationships\n   - Focus on relative timing (before/after/during), overlaps, and sequences\n   - Explore event durations and time gaps between events\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"iPhone launch date\" → January 2007\n   Step 2: \"iPhone development timeline\" → Started 2004, announced 2007\n   Step 3: \"Competitor smartphones 2004-2007\" → BlackBerry peak, Nokia dominance\n   Benefit: Enables temporal reasoning questions about sequences and windows\n\n5. COLLECT QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION\n   - Gather numerical data: counts, rankings, measurements, statistics\n   - Explore comparisons and relative quantities\n   - Record ordinal information (first, second, largest, etc.)\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"SpaceX funding rounds\" → Series A $20M (2008), Series B $50M (2009)\n   Step 2: \"SpaceX employee growth\" → 100 (2005) → 1000 (2010) → 10000 (2020)\n   Benefit: Enables quantitative reasoning and ranking questions\n\n6. EXPLORE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS\n   - Focus on cause-effect relationships, influences, and dependencies\n   - Explore contributing factors and consequences\n   - Identify multi-factor causality chains\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"Nokia market decline causes\" → iPhone disruption, slow to adapt\n   Step 2: \"Nokia smartphone strategy 2007-2010\" → Symbian OS limitations\n   Step 3: \"Nokia Microsoft partnership\" → Result of declining market share\n   Benefit: Creates causal reasoning chains for complex questions\n\n7. EXPLORE NEGATIVE AND EXCLUSION INFORMATION\n   - Collect information about what did NOT happen or what entities lack\n   - Explore exclusions, exceptions, and contrasts\n   - Document entities that were considered but rejected\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Step 1: \"Apple acquisition attempts\" → Tried to acquire Dropbox (declined)\n   Step 2: \"Companies Apple did not acquire\" → Rejected partnerships\n   Benefit: Enables negation-based reasoning questions\n\n=== QUALITY CHECKLIST ===\n✓ Did I explore at least 3 distinct entities?\n✓ Did I collect temporal information (dates, durations, sequences)?\n✓ Did I gather quantitative data (numbers, rankings, counts)?\n✓ Did I explore causal relationships and dependencies?\n✓ Did I find similar entities for disambiguation scenarios?\n✓ Did I collect both positive facts and negative/exclusion information?\n✓ Can these discoveries form complex reasoning chains with temporal, quantitative, and causal elements?",
  "synthesis_tips": "QA Synthesis Guidelines:\n\n=== CORE PRINCIPLES ===\n\n1. FULL TRAJECTORY UTILIZATION\n   - Synthesized questions must utilize ALL trajectory information comprehensively\n   - Connect multiple discovered entities and relationships into coherent reasoning chains\n   - Avoid leaving any explored information unused\n   - You can only use information in the trajectories, don't use your internal knowledge\n\n2. CONCISE EXPRESSION REQUIREMENTS\n   - Questions MUST be concise and direct, avoiding verbose narratives and lengthy storytelling\n   - Eliminate redundant descriptions and dragging explanations\n   - Focus on essential constraints and reasoning requirements only\n   - Maintain full semantic meaning while minimizing word count\n   - DO NOT use unnecessarily long or convoluted sentence structures\n   - Answers MUST be brief - typically just a few words (name, date, number, or short phrase)\n   - Avoid full sentences in answers unless absolutely necessary\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Example:\n   Question: \"Which company, founded by two Stanford graduates in 1998 and known for its search algorithm based on page ranking, became the parent of Alphabet in 2015?\"\n   Answer: \"Google\"\n   \n   ✗ BAD Example:\n   Question: \"There is a company that was founded in a certain year by individuals who had studied at a particular institution... [multiple paragraphs of indirect clues]...\"\n   Answer: \"The company's name is Google, which was founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998.\"\n\n3. INFORMATION OBFUSCATION STRATEGIES\n   - All entities, relationships, and attributes must be obfuscated\n   - Replace specific names with descriptive attributes to require multi-hop reasoning\n   \n   Obfuscation Types:\n   A) Entity: 'Albert Einstein' → 'a physicist who developed the theory of relativity'\n   B) Relationship: 'X is the CEO of Y' → 'X leads company Y as its highest executive'\n   C) Temporal: '1969' → 'the year humans first landed on the moon'\n   D) Location: 'MIT' → 'a prestigious technical institute in Massachusetts'\n   E) Quantitative: '$100 billion' → 'surpassed the valuation of most Fortune 500 companies'\n\n4. COMPLEX GRAPH-BASED REASONING STRUCTURE\n   - Generate questions requiring reasoning through a COMPLEX GRAPH\n   - Minimum: >=10 nodes (entities/concepts) and >=10 edges (relationships)\n   - Support multiple reasoning structure types: chains, trees, DAGs, convergent paths\n   \n   ✓ GOOD Pattern - CONVERGENT REASONING:\n   Path A: Clue1 → E1 → E2 → Partial_Info_A\n   Path B: Clue2 → E3 → E4 → E5 → Partial_Info_B\n   Path C: Clue3 → E6 → E7 → Partial_Info_C\n   Answer requires: Partial_Info_A AND Partial_Info_B AND Partial_Info_C\n\n5. AVOID REASONING SHORTCUTS\n   - Ensure NO reasoning shortcuts exist\n   - All provided clues should be NECESSARY and COMPLEMENTARY, not redundant\n   - Multiple paths must be needed, not just one sufficient path\n\n=== ADVANCED DIFFICULTY ENHANCEMENTS ===\n\n6. ADVERSARIAL DISAMBIGUATION\n   - Include multiple similar entities requiring fine-grained distinction\n   - Design questions with multiple candidate answers needing constraint synthesis\n   \n   ✓ Example:\n   \"Among three engineers with similar backgrounds who joined the company in the same year, identify the one who both led the security project AND previously worked at a defense contractor acquired before the year the company went public.\"\n   \n   Requirements:\n   - Multiple similar candidates exist in trajectory\n   - Unique answer requires combining multiple distinguishing constraints\n   - Each constraint alone is insufficient\n\n7. TEMPORAL REASONING COMPLEXITY\n   - Require time window constraints, duration calculations, or relative positioning\n   \n   ✓ Example:\n   \"Identify the project launched between the company's Series B funding and its first product recall, which had a development period longer than its predecessor but shorter than the average industry standard at that time.\"\n   \n   Requirements:\n   - Time window: between two events\n   - Duration comparison: longer than X, shorter than Y\n   - Relative temporal positioning\n\n8. NEGATION & EXCLUSION REASONING\n   - Incorporate negative constraints and contrastive exclusion\n   \n   ✓ Example:\n   \"Find the executive who joined the company after its IPO but never worked in the hardware division, unlike all other executives hired that year, and who was the only one not promoted within three years.\"\n   \n   Requirements:\n   - Negative constraint: never worked in X\n   - Contrastive: unlike others\n   - Exclusion: the only one not\n\n9. QUANTITATIVE REASONING\n   - Require numerical calculations, ranking, or threshold judgments\n   \n   ✓ Example:\n   \"Among the company's acquisitions valued above $50M, identify the third-largest by employee count where the time gap between announcement and completion was less than half the average for that year's acquisitions.\"\n   \n   Requirements:\n   - Threshold: above $50M\n   - Ranking: third-largest\n   - Calculation: time gap less than half the average\n\n10. CAUSAL CHAIN REASONING\n    - Require establishing complete cause-effect chains with multiple factors\n    \n    ✓ Example:\n    \"What event was the direct result of both the CEO's departure and the failed product launch, which together caused the board restructuring that enabled the technology pivot?\"\n    \n    Requirements:\n    - Multi-factor causality: both factor A and factor B\n    - Causal chain: causes → intermediate effect → final outcome\n    - Direct vs indirect causation\n\n11. IMPLICIT INFORMATION & PREMISE IDENTIFICATION\n    - Require inference of unstated premises from multiple facts\n    \n    ✓ Example:\n    \"Identify the researcher who must have attended the 1995 conference, given that: (1) all conference speakers received the commemorative award, (2) this researcher has the award in their office, (3) no awards were distributed outside the conference, and (4) the researcher published work citing discussions from that conference.\"\n    \n    Requirements:\n    - Answer not directly stated\n    - Requires logical inference from multiple premises\n    - Multiple evidence pieces converge to implicit conclusion\n\n=== ENHANCED QUALITY CHECKLIST ===\nBefore finalizing, verify:\n✓ Is the question concise and direct, avoiding verbose narratives?\n✓ Is the answer brief (just a few words)?\n✓ Are ALL entities, relationships, and attributes properly obfuscated?\n✓ Does the question involve >=10 nodes and >=10 edges?\n✓ Is the reasoning structure a complex graph (not linear chain)?\n✓ Does the question use ALL key trajectory information?\n✓ Are there multiple reasoning paths that converge to the answer?\n✓ Does it require disambiguation among similar entities?\n✓ Does it include temporal reasoning beyond simple date matching?\n✓ Does it incorporate negation or exclusion constraints?\n✓ Does it require quantitative reasoning or calculations?\n✓ Does it require establishing causal chains?\n✓ Does it require inferring implicit information from multiple premises?\n✓ Are all clues necessary and complementary (no shortcuts)?\n✓ Can every reasoning step be mapped to specific trajectory evidence?",
