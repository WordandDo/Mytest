It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \\\"\\\"MINERGIE-P\\\"\\\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design. Although it is principally applied to new buildings, it has also been\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nused for refurbishments. By late 2008, estimates of the number of Passivhaus buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures. As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the \\\"\\\"Institut f\\u00fcr Wohnen und Umwelt\\\"\\\" (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany). Later, their concept was further developed through a number of research projects, aided\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nof Sweden and Denmark. The Passivhaus standard requires that the building fulfills the following requirements: These standards are much higher than houses built to most normal building codes. For comparisons, see the international comparisons section below. National partners within the 'consortium for the Promotion of European Passive Houses' are thought to have some flexibility to adapt these limits locally. By achieving the Passivhaus standards, qualified buildings are able to dispense with conventional heating systems. While this is an underlying objective of the Passivhaus standard, some type of heating will still be required and most Passivhaus buildings do include a system\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nfor a Passivhaus setting. Appliance consumer products meeting independent energy efficiency testing and receiving Ecolabel certification marks for reduced electrical-'natural-gas' consumption and product manufacturing carbon emission labels are preferred for use in Passive houses. The ecolabel certification marks of Energy Star and EKOenergy are examples. Typically, passive houses feature: A net zero-energy building (ZEB) is a building that over a year does not use more energy than it generates. The first 1979 Zero Energy Design building used passive solar heating and cooling techniques with air-tight construction and super insulation. A few ZEB's fail to fully exploit more affordable conservation technology\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nand all use onsite active renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic to offset the building's primary energy consumption. Passive House and ZEB are complementary synergistic technology approaches, based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage: ZEBs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kWh/m\\u00b2 with help from on-site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the Passive House demand constraint of 120 kWh/m\\u00b2 which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources.

The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard.

This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001.

In 2006, Waldsee opened the \\\"\\\"BioHaus\\\"\\\", the first certified passive house in North America, on its permanent site near Bemidji, Minnesota. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code. The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nprivate clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year. In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \\\"\\\"The Smith House\\\"\\\" in Urbana, Illinois . From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nPassive house Passive house () is a rigorous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building, which reduces the building's ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \\\"\\\"MINERGIE-P\\\"\\\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design. Although it is principally applied to new buildings, it has also been\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nand all use onsite active renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic to offset the building's primary energy consumption. Passive House and ZEB are complementary synergistic technology approaches, based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage: ZEBs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kWh/m\\u00b2 with help from on-site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the Passive House demand constraint of 120 kWh/m\\u00b2 which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources. Energy Plus houses are similar to both PassivHaus and ZEB but emphasize the\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nused for refurbishments. By late 2008, estimates of the number of Passivhaus buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures. As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia.

Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling. The Mediator design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known \\\"\\\"GoF design patterns\\\"\\\" that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.

Defining a set\\n---\\n\\\"Mediator pattern\\\"\\nMediator pattern In software engineering, the mediator pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior. Usually a program is made up of a large number of classes. Logic and computation are distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are added to a program, especially during maintenance and/or refactoring, the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain.

Data can be synced between services like MobileMe and Gmail to devices like Macs, PCs, and mobile devices. The sync services are utilized by several applications including Address Book, iCal, Mail. Conflict Resolver is executed in the event that a sync service cannot decide on which version of the data to use, creating a conflict. The user is prompted to choose which version of the data to use (MobileMe or local) and whether the user wishes to apply the same changes to all conflicts or review them\\n---\\n\\\"Application domain\\\"\\nApplication domain An application domain is a mechanism (similar to a process in an operating system) used within the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to isolate executed software applications from one another so that they do not affect each other. Each application domain has its own virtual address space which scopes the resources for the application domain using that address space. A CLI application domain is contained within an operating system process. A process may contain many application domains. Application domains have isolation properties similar to that of operating system processes: In this sense, a CLI is like a mini-operating system.\\n---\\n\\\"Online dispute resolution\\\"\\nMediators use information management skills encouraging parties to reach an amicable agreement by enabling them to communicate more effectively through the rephrasing of their arguments. Conciliation is similar to mediation, but the conciliator can propose solutions for the parties to consider before an agreement is reached. Also, assisted negotiation procedures are designed to improve parties' communications through the assistance of a third party or software. In fact, it has been argued that assisted negotiation, conciliation, and even facilitation, are just different words for mediation.

Thus, ODR is useful for resolving brick and mortar disputes that arise in businesses, insurance companies and municipalities, who are finding that ODR saves them money and time when dealing with B2C disputes. In assisted negotiation the technology assists the negotiation process between the parties. The technology has a similar role as the mediator in a mediation.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

Guice allows implementation classes to be bound programmatically to an interface, then injected into constructors, methods or fields using an codice_1 annotation. When more than one implementation of the same interface is needed, the user can create custom annotations that identify an implementation, then use that annotation when injecting it.\\n---\\nFlatBuffers\\nFlatBuffers In computer programming, FlatBuffers is a free software library implementing a serialization format similar to Protocol Buffers, Thrift, Apache Avro, SBE, and Cap'n Proto, primarily written by Wouter van Oortmerssen and open-sourced by Google.

Much more successful among early mod-making tools was the 1992 \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\" from Strategic Simulations, Inc., which allowed users to construct games based on the game world that was launched with the \\\"\\\"Pool of Radiance\\\"\\\" game.

CAMP is designed to address the needs of a high-level PaaS system; one in which the consumer (generally a developer or application administrator) provides application artifacts (code, data, graphics, etc.) and specifies which provider-supplied services are required to realize these artifacts as an application. The details of the infrastructure (compute, storage, and networking) used to support these services are hidden from the consumer by the provider of the PaaS system.

In 2003, Citrix Systems acquired Expertcity, then a major player in web-based desktop access, in a transaction valued at approximately $225 million in cash and stock. Expertcity became the Citrix Online division of Citrix and retained many of the key developers of the original company. At the time of the acquisition, Expertcity was developing GoToMeeting, a product that uses the remote desktop engine to allow multiple users to view and control a single desktop, enabling both collaborative support and collaborative presentations.

Citrix also earned $75 million through the agreement, along with a royalty arrangement that was valued at approximately $100 million. Citrix released MetaFrame 1.0 in conjunction with Terminal Server Edition. Due to weaknesses in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), Terminal Server Edition worked best using the ICA protocol developed by Citrix and found in MetaFrame. This meant that Citrix technology was purchased and installed on most machines running Terminal Server Edition.
