The reason for this diversity is because some schools provide vocational education as part of their high school curriculum (thereby allowing them to hand out \\\"\\\"Technician\\\"\\\" titles) while elsewhere, the student is required to decide whether to study Sciences or Humanities for the last two years of secondary school.

The term survived despite the fact that nowadays a doctorate is typically needed in order to teach at a university. The term is also used for a person who holds a licentiate. In English, the degree has never been called a license. In French-speaking countries, the bachelor's degree is called a \\\"\\\"licence\\\"\\\". In Sweden, Finland, and in some other European university systems, a 'licentiate' is a postgraduate degree between the master's degree and the doctorate. The licentiate is a popular\\n---\\n\\\"Colegio de Bio\\u0301logos del Peru\\u0301\\\"\\nColegio de Bi\\u00f3logos del Per\\u00fa Colegio de Bi\\u00f3logos del Per\\u00fa or College of Biologists of Peru is a professional association in Peru. This college accepts only graduates in biology that have opted to be licensed through a special inter-university procedure called \\\"\\\"Licenciatura\\\"\\\". It was founded in 1972 and its creation was sanctioned by Law . According to Peruvian law, in order to work as a professional biologist one must be registered and be a dues-paying active member of the Colegio de Bi\\u00f3logos del Per\\u00fa. It is governed by a National Dean or President, who is elected every two years by\\n---\\n\\\"Engineer's degree\\\"\\n(\\\"\\\"c\\u00e9dula profesional\\\"\\\") that certifies him or her as an engineer. The graduate has different abilities and capabilities related to the nature of the title Engineer. In this case, having a professional credential (\\\"\\\"c\\u00e9dula profesional\\\"\\\") in engineering allows you to undertake various engineering-only activities and certifies the ability of the engineer to exercise their profession. For engineering, completing all taught courses of a \\\"\\\"Licenciatura\\\"\\\" does not automatically award the graduate the title and licence of \\\"\\\"Ingeniero\\\"\\\"; for this, it depends on the name of the career and having the prefix \\\"\\\"Ingenier\\u00eda\\\"\\\" attached to the name of the degree. It is the\\n---\\n\\\"Academic degree\\\"\\nSuperior Universitario\\\"\\\" (University Higher Technician, to distinguish from Science Technician). Universities award the student with the title of \\\"\\\"Ingeniero\\\"\\\" (Engineer) or with the title \\\"\\\"Licenciado\\\"\\\" (Licentiate) after completing a five-year program. The Engineer have more physics subjects than the Licentiate, but both are five-year careers. Some higher education institutions may award \\\"\\\"Diplomados\\\"\\\" (Diploma) but the time necessary to obtain one varies. Medical Doctors are awarded the title \\\"\\\"M\\u00e9dico Cirujano\\\"\\\" after completing a 6 year-career.
