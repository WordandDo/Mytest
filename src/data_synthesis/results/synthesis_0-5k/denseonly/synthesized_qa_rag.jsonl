{"question": "A public library in a municipality located in a southwestern suburb of a European capital, within a département that borders the Seine, is associated with a historical funicular that operated from 1893 to 1934 and connected two stations on different railway lines. This library is situated in a town built on hills and served by twelve bus lines of a specific transit network. The area was once served by the funicular, a model of which is displayed in the local Museum of Art and History. The town is twinned with several other cities. Among the public institutions in this municipality, the library in question is one of the public schools listed. The funicular was designed by three engineers and had a single track. The library is not the central library of a network in a different French city designed by a Danish architect, nor is it a national library or a multimedia library focused on 19th- and 20th-century music. It is also not a library in a Swiss town with a collection of approximately 64,994 items. Given that the library is specifically named after the funicular's location and is located in the municipality that houses the funicular's model in its museum, what is the name of this library?", "answer": "Médiathèque de Bellevue", "trajectory_id": "src_0009_9d93071a_traj_0", "reasoning_steps": [{"step": 1, "action": "Identify the starting entity and location from the trajectory."}, {"step": 2, "action": "Extract details about the historical funicular (Bellevue funicular) that operated from 1893 to 1934 in Meudon, Hauts-de-Seine."}, {"step": 3, "action": "Note that Meudon is a southwestern suburb of Paris, in the Hauts-de-Seine département, and is served by twelve RATP bus lines."}, {"step": 4, "action": "Confirm that a model of the Bellevue funicular is in the local Museum of Art and History in Meudon."}, {"step": 5, "action": "Exclude other libraries mentioned in the trajectory: Bibliothèque nationale de France, Média­thèque Musicale Mahler, Médiathèques de Saint-Étienne, Bibliothèque Méjanes, and the Swiss library in Vevey."}, {"step": 6, "action": "Establish that the library is a public institution in Meudon, associated with the Bellevue area, and listed among public schools in the municipality."}, {"step": 7, "action": "Link the library's name directly to the Bellevue funicular location, as indicated by multiple queries targeting 'Médiathèque de Bellevue Meudon'."}, {"step": 8, "action": "Synthesize that the only library fitting all constraints—location in Meudon, association with the Bellevue funicular, and presence in the municipality's public institutions—is the Médiathèque de Bellevue."}], "source_id": "src_0009_9d93071a", "qa_id": "src_0009_9d93071a_traj_0_qa_0", "metadata": {"seed_data": "médiathèque de Bellevue: ", "seed_description": "Starting entity and its description", "trajectory_depth": 20, "synthesis_date": "2025-12-13T21:39:35.332759", "environment_mode": "rag"}}
{"question": "A plot to assassinate two monarchs was discovered in June 1683 after an informant named Josiah Keeling revealed details to Sir Leoline Jenkins, the Secretary of State, via an intermediary courtier and George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth. Two conspirators, William Spence (alias Butler) and Abraham Holmes, were arrested that same month. Among the documents related to this plot, a specific type of cheap sensational pamphlet was produced. This pamphlet's title is also the name of a detective novel published in 1953 by a famous British author whose works include titles referencing nursery rhymes. This author wrote a novel featuring a detective who is an elderly woman and is the creator of a fictional village. The pamphlet, which shares its name with this 1953 novel, is a 'penny blood.'

{"question": "The Avro 730 was a planned aircraft being developed for the Royal Air Force (RAF) to perform aerial reconnaissance missions, conforming with the requirements of Air Ministry Specification OR.330. It was later modified to accommodate arming with nuclear weapons, intended to be armed with a nuclear-tipped stand-off missile using a warhead that had started development as Blue Rosette. The aircraft's design closely resembled that of the proposed British Skylon spaceplane, though it was not a spaceplane. Its bomb bay was narrow but very long at 50 ft (15 m), and the crew was reduced to two members in the new version, which featured rectangular canards, a 'hidden' cockpit, and a large cropped-delta vertical fin at the rear. What type of aircraft was the Avro 730?", "answer": "Mach 3 reconnaissance aircraft and strategic bomber", "trajectory_id": "src_0006_40f22d30_traj_1", "reasoning_steps": [{"step": 1, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 2, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 3, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 4, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 5, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 6, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 7, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 8, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 9, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 10, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 11, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 12, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 13, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 14, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}, {"step": 15, "action": "query_knowledge_base_dense"}], "source_id": "src_0006_40f22d30", "qa_id": "src_0006_40f22d30_traj_1_qa_0", "metadata": {"seed_data": "Avro 730: type of aircraft", "seed_description": "Starting entity and its description", "trajectory_depth": 15, "synthesis_date": "2025-12-13T22:55:12.182637", "environment_mode": "rag"}}
