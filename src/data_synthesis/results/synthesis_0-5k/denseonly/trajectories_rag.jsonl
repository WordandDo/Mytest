Keeling had contacted a courtier, who put him in touch with George Legge, 1st Baron Dartmouth, and Dartmouth had brought him to Jenkins, Secretary of State.

Apenheul Primate Park opened in 1971 as a small but revolutionary park housing wool-monkeys and other species. It is located in the nature park of Berg en Bos (Mountain and Wood) and proved popular with visitors and primatologists alike, leading to subsequent expansions.

The park, which primarily consists of pine forest and bamboo vegetation, contains nearly 6,000 trees and more than 70 plant species endemic to Madagascar, all of which are segregated into separate climatic zones throughout the park.

The building was subsequently replaced. Apenheul is home to about 70 species of animals, 35 of which are primates. The park houses lemurs from Madagascar, monkeys from Central and South America, and monkeys and apes from Asia and Africa.

The envisioned reconnaissance aircraft would be capable of successfully entering the airspace of the Soviet Union while avoiding the sophisticated hostile air defenses intended to combat such an intrusion.

This freed up funds for the Blue Streak missile programme, but it too was cancelled, on 24 February 1960. To extend the effectiveness and operational life of the V bombers, an Operational Requirement (OR1132), was issued on 3 September 1954 for an air-launched, rocket-propelled standoff missile with a range of that could be launched from a V bomber. This became Blue Steel. The Ministry of Supply placed a development contract with Avro in March 1956, and it\\n---\\n\\\"Blue Streak (missile)\\\"\\ncontinuing the project. The project was unexpectedly canceled in April 1960. Whitehall opposition grew, and it was canceled on the ostensible grounds that it would be too vulnerable to a first-strike attack. Admiral of the Fleet Lord Mountbatten had spent considerable effort arguing that the project should be cancelled at once in favour of the Navy being armed with nuclear weapons, capable of pre-emptive strike. Some considered the cancellation of Blue Streak to be not only a blow to British military-industrial efforts, but also to Commonwealth ally Australia, which had its own vested interest in the project. The British military\\n---\\n\\\"Polaris (UK nuclear programme)\\\"\\nand could attack China, for example. With the cancellation of Blue Streak in the air, the British Nuclear Deterrent Study Group (BNDSG) produced a study on 23 December 1959 that argued that Polaris was expensive and unproven, and given the time it would take to build the boats, could not be deployed before the early 1970s. The Chiefs of Staff Committee therefore recommended the purchase of the American Skybolt, an air-launched ballistic missile, with Polaris as a possible successor in the 1970s. The British government decided to cancel Blue Streak if it could acquire Skybolt.

Saunders-Roe, recognising that it would need to outdo the competing Avro 720 if the SR.53 was to be likely to survive, upon having been issued with the contract to build the three prototypes, set a schedule that called for a first flight to be conducted in July 1954, along with a projected service introduction date of 1957.

The follow-up order was cancelled when the Avro 730 programme was cancelled in 1957 as part of that year's review of defence spending. The 188 project was continued as a high speed research aircraft.

In early 1957, the Avro 730 was abruptly cancelled, along with the development of a number of other manned aircraft, as a consequence of the 1957 Defence White Paper.

The Avro 730 was a very high speed aircraft, originally designed solely for aerial reconnaissance purposes. In order to achieve the desired high speed performance, the aircraft consisted of a long, slender fuselage with a high fineness ratio; a small tapered almost-rectangular wing was mounted centrally on the fuselage.

Due to features such as the automatic flight controls and stabilisation systems, the pilot was intended to be capable of supervising some of the aircraft's engineering functions as well, such as the control system, cooling and fuel systems. Cooling was a critical issue for the Avro 730; at Mach 2, the external skin was anticipated to reach 190 \\u00b0C, this would rise to 277 \\u00b0C at Mach 2.7.

The V-bombers were purpose-built to be armed with the first generation of Britain's nuclear weapons, designated as Blue Danube, and served as the airborne carriers of Britain's nuclear deterrence for many years.

By operating at such a high altitude and speed, along with assorted advanced electronic systems on board, it was believed that the specified aircraft would be capable of evading the threats posed by Soviet interceptor aircraft and newly developed surface-to-air missiles alike.

As such, the Air Staff set about formulating an Operational Requirement; in 1954, Specification OR.330, which specified the required performance attributes for such an aircraft, was issued accordingly. The envisioned reconnaissance aircraft would be capable of successfully entering the airspace of the Soviet Union while avoiding the sophisticated hostile air defenses intended to combat such an intrusion. In order to achieve this feat, the aircraft would have to be capable of maintaining Mach 2.5 at an altitude of 60,000 ft (18,300 m), along with the ability to attain\\n---\\n\\\"Avro 730\\\"\\nmaterials and futuristic propulsion systems.

Following the end of the Second World War and facing the threats of the newly emerging Cold War, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was keen to not only preserve but to strengthen its strategic capabilities.

Aspects and influences of the Avro 730 encouraged studies at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, into supersonic transport aircraft, which in turn eventually contributed to the development effort behind Concorde. The Avro 730 was a very high speed aircraft, originally designed solely for aerial reconnaissance purposes. In order to achieve the desired high speed performance, the aircraft consisted of a long, slender fuselage with a high fineness ratio; a small tapered almost-rectangular wing was mounted centrally on the fuselage.

In the new version, the crew was reduced to two members. The bomb bay was narrow but very long at 50 ft (15 m), and was intended to be armed with a nuclear-tipped stand-off missile. A suitable warhead had started development as Blue Rosette. The design Avro 730 closely resembles that of the proposed British Skylon spaceplane, although it is unclear if the two aircraft are at all related or if the resemblance is mere coincidence.

On the intended initial development models, a raised canopy would have been present for direct vision; however, production aircraft would have made sole use of an electrically operated retractable periscope in order to provide an external view, including during take-off and landing.

As an aid to development, the Bristol Type 188 aircraft was built to test the compound-delta wing shape, and later, the effects of prolonged supersonic flight on metal. Up to 10 prototypes of the aircraft were proposed, necessitated in part by a decision made part-way through the development process to give the aircraft a bombing capability.

Longitudinal control was provided by the nose-mounted tail plane via trailing edge elevators, lateral control was enacted by ailerons located on the wing's trailing edge, and directional control was achieved by a conventional rudder. All four of the primary flight control surfaces were actuated by a quadruple-redundant electro-hydraulic control unit, designed by Boulton Paul.

Possible English translations include pork blood stew or blood pudding stew. \\\"\\\"Dinuguan\\\"\\\" is also called \\\"\\\"sinugaok\\\"\\\" in Batangas, \\\"\\\"zinagan\\\"\\\" in Ibanag, \\\"\\\"twik\\\"\\\" in Itawis, \\\"\\\"tid-tad\\\"\\\" in Kapampangan, \\\"\\\"dinardaraan\\\"\\\" in Ilocano,\\n---\\nSinigang\\nvegetables commonly used in the making of sinigang include okra, taro corms (\\\"\\\"gabi\\\"\\\"), white radish (\\\"\\\"laban\\u00f3s\\\"\\\"), water spinach (\\\"\\\"kangk\\u00f3ng\\\"\\\"), yardlong beans (\\\"\\\"sitaw\\\"\\\") and eggplant (\\\"\\\"tal\\u00f3ng\\\"\\\"). Most Filipinos like to cook sinigang with green long peppers in order to enhance the taste and add a little spice to the dish. Another variation includes adding locally made miso. \\\"\\\"Sinampalukang man\\u00f3k\\\"\\\" or \\\"\\\"sinampalukan\\\"\\\" (from \\\"\\\"sampalok\\\"\\\") is technically not a variation of sinigang, as the chicken has to be saut\\u00e9ed in ginger first instead of all the ingredients being placed simultaneously into the pot and brought to a boil. \\\"\\\"Sinampalukan\\\"\\\" is also distinguished by\\n---\\nSausage\\nstuffed with various ingredients. The most common variation is composed of pork blood, cellophane noodle, sliced carrot and barley stuffed into pig intestines, but other regional variations include squid or Alaska pollock casings. Sundae is eaten plain with salt, in stews, or as part of a stir-fry. In the Philippines, there are different kinds of sausages called \\\"\\\"longaniza\\\"\\\" (Filipino languages: \\\"\\\"longganisa\\\"\\\") with mixes dependent on their size of origin: \\\"\\\"Longaniza de Vigan\\\"\\\" (\\\"\\\"longganisang Vigan\\\"\\\"), \\\"\\\"Longaniza de Lucban\\\"\\\" (\\\"\\\"longganisang Lucban\\\"\\\"), and \\\"\\\"Longaniza de Cebu\\\"\\\" (\\\"\\\"longganisang Sugbo/Cebu\\\"\\\") are examples.

It is cooked by adding stir-fried garlic to rice and then seasoning the mixture with salt and pepper.

The Northern Luzon versions of the dish namely the Ilocano \\\"\\\"dinardaraan\\\"\\\" and the Ibanag \\\"\\\"zinagan\\\"\\\" are often drier with toppings of deep-fried pork intestine cracklings. The Itawis of Cagayan also have a pork-based version that has larger meat chunks and more fat, which they call \\\"\\\"twik\\\"\\\".

The Northern Luzon versions of the dish namely the Ilocano \\\"\\\"dinardaraan\\\"\\\" and the Ibanag \\\"\\\"zinagan\\\"\\\" are often drier with toppings of deep-fried pork intestine cracklings.

The dish consists of either fresh or fermented rice, kneaded with boiled fish (usually caught from the Inle Lake, such as nga gyin), fresh tomato paste, mashed boiled potatoes and garlic garnish. Highland Shan rice, similar to Japanese rice, is used alongside the creamier Shan potatoes, giving the dish a very rich texture. Garlic chives roots, garlic oil and crispy garlic garnish are added\\n---\\n\\\"Pares (food)\\\"\\nPares (food) The Filipino term Pares commonly refers to Beef Pares, a braised beef stew served with garlic fried rice, and a bowl of clear soup. It is particularly associated with specialty roadside diner-style establishments known as \\\"\\\"Pares House\\\"\\\" that specialize in serving these type of meals. In recent years, it had also become a common dish served in \\\"\\\"karinderyas\\\"\\\", small eateries that serve economical meals for local residents. Informally, \\\"\\\"Pares\\\"\\\" can also refer to any dish that is cooked in the manner reminiscent of the \\\"\\\"asado-style\\\"\\\" (i.e. stewed in a sweet-soy sauce).

Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chive, and \\\"\\\"Chinese onion\\\"\\\". Garlic is native to Central Asia and northeastern Iran, and has long been a common seasoning worldwide, with a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use. It was known to ancient Egyptians, and has been used both as a food flavoring and as a traditional medicine. China produces some 80% of the world supply of garlic. The word \\\"\\\"garlic\\\"\\\" derives from Middle English, \\\"\\\"garlek\\\"\\\", meaning \\\"\\\"gar\\\"\\\" (spear) and leek, as a 'spear-shaped leek'.\\n---\\n\\\"Allium tuberosum\\\"\\na curried vegetable dish of potatoes and \\\"\\\"A. tuberosum\\\"\\\" known as \\\"\\\"dunduko sag\\\"\\\". In Thailand, they are known as \\\"\\\"gui chai\\\"\\\". In Vietnam, the leaves of garlic chives, known as \\\"\\\"h\\u1eb9\\\"\\\", are cut up into short pieces and used as the only vegetable in a broth with sliced pork kidneys. In Kazakhstan, where the plant has been introduced through cultivation by Dungan farmers and ties with neighboring China, garlic chives are known by a transliteration of their Mandarin Chinese name, djutsey (\\u0434\\u0436\\u0443\\u0446\\u0435\\u0439). Used in cooking, it is sometimes added as a filling to manty, samsa, yuta, and other typical dishes.\\n---\\n\\\"Garlic sauce\\\"\\nIt is used as an ingredient to add flavor to bamia and koshary. Taratoor is a creamy garlic sauce in Arab cuisine of the Persian Gulf and French cuisine that is a predecessor to aioli. It was first prepared in the Greater Syrian region by peasants. It was later brought to the Iberian peninsula by Phoenicians, and was also brought to the Iberian peninsula at a later time by Arabs. From there, the sauce was brought to Southern France. Taratoor has been described as \\\"\\\"an integral part of the Arab Gulf countries' cuisines\\\"\\\". Tomato-garlic sauce is prepared using tomatoes as\\n---\\nGarlic\\nparts of Latin America. Latin American seasonings, particularly, use garlic in sofritos and mofongos. Oils can be flavored with garlic cloves. These infused oils are used to season all categories of vegetables, meats, breads and pasta. Garlic, along with fish sauce, chopped fresh chilis, lime juice, sugar, and water, is a basic essential item in dipping fish sauce, a highly used dipping sauce condiment used in Indochina. In East and Southeast Asia, chili oil with garlic is a popular dipping sauce, especially for meat and seafood.

Other works were planned for 2003.\\n---\\n\\\"Me\\u0301diathe\\u0300ques de Saint-E\\u0301tienne\\\"\\nTarentaize in 1993. The library network consists of a central library in Tarentaize, six smaller libraries and two bookmobiles. The central library of Tarentaize was designed by Danish architect Henning Larsen in collaboration with the architectural firm Arch from Saint Etienne. They used the same blueprints that the library of Gentofte, Denmark, was built upon. The library of Tarentaize opened to the public on 19 October 1993. At 6000 sq m, it is the largest library in Saint-\\u00c9tienne. The collections are located on the first floor, while the offices and an exhibition space are located on the second floor. The\\n---\\nVevey\\nwas visited by 61,358 visitors (the average in previous years was 57,530). In the same year the \\\"\\\"Mus\\u00e9e Jenish\\\"\\\" was closed for renovations but the average in previous years was 17,286, and the \\\"\\\"Mus\\u00e9e suisse de l'appareil photo\\\"\\\" was visited by 10,989 visitors (the average in previous years was 11,874). Vevey is home to the \\\"\\\"Biblioth\\u00e8que m\\u00e9diath\\u00e8que municipale\\\"\\\" library. The library has () 64,994 books or other media, and loaned out 153,629 items in the same year. It was open a total of 273 days with average of 34 hours per week during that year. The action of Rousseau's \\\"\\\"Julie,\\n---\\n\\\"Me\\u0301diathe\\u0300ques de Saint-E\\u0301tienne\\\"\\nlibrary of Tarentaize also houses the Cinematheque of Saint-\\u00c9tienne. Bookmobiles were launched in 1968 in order to grant the population an easier access to culture. Two vehicles currently exist : one intended for the youth and the other one for adults, which has slightly changed over the years and is now targeting all audiences. These two bookmobiles tour the areas which are deprived of library buildings, with the youth bookmobile also visiting schools. The central library of Tarentaize and the smaller libraries all hold both youth and adult collections, except the library of Solaure, which collections are solely youth-oriented. The\\n---\\n\\\"Gare du Sud\\\"\\nincluded the construction of a media library and sports complex, as well as the rehabilitation of the School of Fine Arts, and creation of a 1300-space parking lot. The design was approved by the Ministry of Culture on 12 May 2005. The first phase of the project, the internal and external renovation of the station building, took place in 2013. Work was completed by December of that year and the building was re-opened on 4 January 2014. The new \\\"\\\"Raoul Mille\\\"\\\" library has been incorporated into the station's former waiting room and the building now houses multimedia rooms, meeting rooms\\n---\\n\\\"Bellevue, Switzerland\\\"\\nvotes with a name that was not on the list.

In response to the tragedy, the Spanish government devised and enacted the \\\"\\\"Plan Sur\\\"\\\", which rerouted the city's main river, the Turia. Previous floods had been recorded in Valencia in 1321, 1328, 1340, 1358, 1406, 1427, 1475, 1517, 1540, 1581, 1589, 1590, 1610, 1651, 1672, 1731, 1776, 1783, 1845, 1860, 1864, 1870 and 1897.

Its most important tributary is\\n---\\nSegura\\ndrop), which typically take place once every 6\\u20139 years approximately, always in Autumn and Spring. Guadalent\\u00edn river, a tributary of Segura, is the wildest European river. In the twentieth century significant flooding occurred in 1946, 1948, 1973, 1982, 1987 and 1989. Since 1990 the lower reaches of the river have been canalized, removing meanders and hence improving the evacuation of flood waters. The new canal was put to the test in September 1997, in October 2000 and in December 2016 when heavy rainfall resulted in significant runoff.

It may be caused by heavy rain associated with a severe thunderstorm, hurricane, tropical storm, or meltwater from ice or snow flowing over ice sheets or snowfields. Flash floods may occur after the collapse of a natural ice or debris dam, or a human structure such as a man-made dam, as occurred before the Johnstown Flood of 1889. Flash floods are distinguished from regular floods by having a timescale of less than six hours.

Rapid flooding events, including flash floods, more often occur on smaller rivers, rivers with steep valleys, rivers that flow for much of their length over impermeable terrain, or normally-dry channels. The cause may be localized convective precipitation (intense thunderstorms) or sudden release from an upstream impoundment created behind a dam, landslide, or glacier.
