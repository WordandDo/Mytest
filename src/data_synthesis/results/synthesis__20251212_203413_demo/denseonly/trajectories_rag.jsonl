A limited array of building blocks were used to build the towns and dungeons, causing some reviewers to complain about the game's monotony. In 2002, \\\"\\\"Morrowind\\\"\\\", the third game in the series, responded to this issue with a smaller, more detailed world containing unique-looking cities and NPCs with greater individuality. \\\"\\\"Daggerfall\\\"\\\" is set in the Iliac Bay, between the provinces of High Rock and Hammerfell.

Many consumer electronic devices (including MP3 players, broadband routers, cell phones, and digital cameras) contain embedded systems based on general-purpose microprocessors and microcontrollers. Most of these devices contain field-programmable components which can be located and accessed by knowledgeable hardware hackers. Field-programming allows hobbyists to replace a device's firmware with new code that can modify or extend its capabilities. Numerous online communities have sprung up around devices found to be particularly conducive to such modification. For example, the iPodLinux and OpenWrt projects have enabled users to run full-featured Linux distributions on their MP3 players and wireless routers,\\n---\\n\\\"Open-source hardware\\\"\\nin its broader sense of \\\"\\\"physical product\\\"\\\".

The first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and spurred by venture capital from Boston and other East Coast investors, many other mines quickly followed.

After the war, the resurgence of the American economy helped Copperweld thrive. The company's management offices relocated from Glassport to downtown Pittsburgh soon after the war.

It is one of the principal oxides of copper, the other being CuO or cupric oxide. This red-coloured solid is a component of some antifouling paints. The compound can appear either yellow or red, depending on the size of the particles. Copper(I) oxide is found as the reddish mineral cuprite. Copper(I) oxide may be produced by several methods. Most straightforwardly, it arises via the oxidation of copper metal: Additives such as water and acids affect the rate of this process as well as the further\\n---\\n\\\"Copper Range Company\\\"\\nbelt and old haulage rope to stabilize them.

From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design.

This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001.

Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

Cuprous oxide is commonly used as a pigment, a fungicide, and an antifouling agent for marine paints. Rectifier diodes based on this material have been used industrially as early as 1924, long before silicon became the standard. Copper(I) oxide is also responsible for the pink color in a positive Benedict's test. Copper(I) oxide Copper(I) oxide or cuprous oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula CuO.

Copper(II) acetate Copper(II) acetate, also referred to as cupric acetate, is the chemical compound with the formula Cu(OAc) where AcO is acetate (). The hydrated derivative, which contains one molecule of water for each Cu atom, is available commercially. Anhydrous Cu(OAc) is a dark green crystalline solid, whereas Cu(OAc)(HO) is more bluish-green. Since ancient times, copper acetates of some form have been used as fungicides and green pigments. Today, copper acetates are used as reagents for the synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds.

The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in Sonoma, California was certified in July 2010. In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \\\"\\\"The Smith House\\\"\\\" in Urbana, Illinois . From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nthe time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001.

The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year. In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the \\\"\\\"Institut f\\u00fcr Wohnen und Umwelt\\\"\\\" (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany).

It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \\\"\\\"MINERGIE-P\\\"\\\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard.

While some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the Passive House standard, others, such as superinsulation, already existed, and the concept of passive solar building design dates back to antiquity.

Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide. In 1996, after the concept had been validated at the Institute in Darmstadt, with space heating at 90% less than that required for a standard new building at\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nused for refurbishments.

As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the \\\"\\\"Institut f\\u00fcr Wohnen und Umwelt\\\"\\\" (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany).

The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in Sonoma, California was certified in July 2010. In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \\\"\\\"The Smith House\\\"\\\" in Urbana, Illinois . From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nthe time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001. The first to be certified was built in 2006 near Bemidji, Minnesota in Camp Waldsee\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nprivate clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year. In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \\\"\\\"MINERGIE-P\\\"\\\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard.

Most straightforwardly, it arises via the oxidation of copper metal: Additives such as water and acids affect the rate of this process as well as the further\\n---\\n\\\"Copper(II) oxide\\\"\\na pigment in ceramics to produce blue, red, and green, and sometimes gray, pink, or black glazes. It is also incorrectly used as a dietary supplement in animal feed. Due to low bioactivity, negligible copper is absorbed. It is also used when welding with copper alloys. Cupric oxide can be used to safely dispose of hazardous materials such as cyanide, hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons and dioxins, through oxidation. The decomposition reactions of phenol and pentachlorophenol follow these pathways: Copper(II) oxide Copper(II) oxide or cupric oxide is the inorganic compound with the formula CuO.

This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001. The first to be certified was built in 2006 near Bemidji, Minnesota in Camp Waldsee\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nprivate clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year. In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

By late 2008, estimates of the number of Passivhaus buildings around the world ranged from 15,000 to 20,000 structures. As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the \\\"\\\"Institut f\\u00fcr Wohnen und Umwelt\\\"\\\" (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany). Later, their concept was further developed through a number of research projects, aided\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nPassive house Passive house () is a rigorous, voluntary standard for energy efficiency in a building, which reduces the building's ecological footprint. It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \\\"\\\"MINERGIE-P\\\"\\\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard. Passive design is not an attachment or supplement to architectural design, but a design process that integrates with architectural design.

In 2011 the city of Heidelberg in Germany initiated the Bahnstadt project, which was seen as the world's largest passive house building area. A company in Qatar was planning the country's first Passive House in 2013, the first in the region. While some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the Passive House standard, others, such as superinsulation, already existed, and the concept of passive solar building design dates back to antiquity.

Solar architecture Solar architecture is an architectural approach that takes in account the Sun to harness clean and renewable solar power. It is related to the fields of optics, thermics, electronics and materials science. Both active and passive solar housing skills are involved in solar architecture. The use of flexible thin-film photovoltaic modules provides fluid integration with steel roofing profiles, enhancing the building's design. Orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air also constitute solar architecture.

No insulation is required on the main facades as they are very efficient in terms of S-value due to the solar shading.

If all houses were to be rebuilt to meet solar architecture standards, this would bring hope, jobs, money, and economical growth. According to an article on ECN's website titled \\\"\\\"Architects just want to develop attractive buildings\\\"\\\", an architect's main purpose is to \\\"\\\"create a spatial object with lines, shapes, colours and texture. These are the challenges for the architect within the customer's programme of requirements.

The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in Sonoma, California was certified in July 2010. In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \\\"\\\"The Smith House\\\"\\\" in Urbana, Illinois . From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nthe time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001. The first to be certified was built in 2006 near Bemidji, Minnesota in Camp Waldsee\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nprivate clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year. In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

As of August 2010, there were approximately 25,000 such certified structures of all types in Europe. The vast majority of passive structures have been built in German-speaking countries and Scandinavia. The Passivhaus standard originated from a conversation in May 1988 between Bo Adamson of Lund University, Sweden, and Wolfgang Feist of the \\\"\\\"Institut f\\u00fcr Wohnen und Umwelt\\\"\\\" (Institute for Housing and the Environment, Darmstadt, Germany). Later, their concept was further developed through a number of research projects, aided\\n---\\n\\\"Waldsee (camp)\\\"\\nsummer for credit. In 2006, Waldsee opened the \\\"\\\"BioHaus\\\"\\\", the first certified passive house in North America, on its permanent site near Bemidji, Minnesota. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code. The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\n2010. In 2011 the city of Heidelberg in Germany initiated the Bahnstadt project, which was seen as the world's largest passive house building area. A company in Qatar was planning the country's first Passive House in 2013, the first in the region. While some techniques and technologies were specifically developed for the Passive House standard, others, such as superinsulation, already existed, and the concept of passive solar building design dates back to antiquity. There was other previous experience with low-energy building standards, notably the German \\\"\\\"Niedrigenergiehaus\\\"\\\" (low-energy house) standard, as well as from buildings constructed to the demanding energy codes\\n---\\n\\\"Passive solar building design\\\"\\nof all passive sources of heat, minimises energy usage, and emphasises the need for high levels of insulation reinforced by meticulous attention to detail in order to address thermal bridging and cold air infiltration. Most of the buildings built to the Passive House standard also incorporate an active heat recovery ventilation unit with or without a small (typically 1 kW) incorporated heating component. The energy design of Passive House buildings is developed using a spreadsheet-based modeling tool called the Passive House Planning Package (PHPP) which is updated periodically. The current version is PHPP2007, where 2007 is the year of issue.\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nand all use onsite active renewable energy technologies like photovoltaic to offset the building's primary energy consumption. Passive House and ZEB are complementary synergistic technology approaches, based on the same physics of thermal energy transfer and storage: ZEBs drive the annual energy consumption down to 0 kWh/m\\u00b2 with help from on-site renewable energy sources and can benefit from materials and methods which are used to meet the Passive House demand constraint of 120 kWh/m\\u00b2 which will minimize the need for the often costly on-site renewable energy sources.

The first US passive retrofit project, the remodeled craftsman O'Neill house in Sonoma, California was certified in July 2010. In the United States, the concept of passive design was first implemented by Katrin Klingenberg in 2003 when she built a passive home prototype named \\\"\\\"The Smith House\\\"\\\" in Urbana, Illinois . From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design. This eventually lead to the inception of the Passive House Institute United States (PHIUS) in 2007. Since then, the\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nthe time, the Economical Passive Houses Working Group was created. This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001. The first to be certified was built in 2006 near Bemidji, Minnesota in Camp Waldsee\\n---\\n\\\"Passive house\\\"\\nprivate clients by the architectural firm Bott, Ridder and Westermeyer. The first Passivhaus residences were built in Darmstadt in 1990, and occupied by the clients the following year. In September 1996, the Passivhaus-Institut was founded in Darmstadt to promote and control Passivhaus standards. Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

It results in ultra-low energy buildings that require little energy for space heating or cooling. A similar standard, \\\"\\\"MINERGIE-P\\\"\\\", is used in Switzerland. The standard is not confined to residential properties; several office buildings, schools, kindergartens and a supermarket have also been constructed to the standard.

Native Americans mined copper from small pits as early as 3000 B.C. The Michigan State Geologist Douglass Houghton (later to become mayor of Detroit) reported on the copper deposits in 1841. The first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and spurred by venture capital from Boston and other East Coast investors, many other mines quickly followed.

After the war, the resurgence of the American economy helped Copperweld thrive. The company's management offices relocated from Glassport to downtown Pittsburgh soon after the war.

The Napoleon mine at Copperopolis in Calaveras County opened in 1860, and was so productive that it ignited a boom in other copper-mining properties from 1862 to 1866.

With the projector and Kinect sensor both facing down on the surface of the sandbox, the projector provides a digital overlay over the sand and the Kinect sensor scans the surface of the map to detect any user gestures inside the boundaries of the sandbox. During development, researchers explored the possibility of incorporating ideas such as multi-touch surfaces, 3D holographic displays, and virtual environments.

From here, she and builder Mike Kernagis co-founded the e-cological Construction Laboratory (e-colab) in 2004 to further explore the feasibility of affordable passive design.

This group developed the planning package and initiated the production of the innovative components that had been used, notably the windows and the high-efficiency ventilation systems. Meanwhile, further passive houses were built in Stuttgart (1993), Naumburg, Hesse, Wiesbaden, and Cologne (1997). Products, which had been developed for the Passivhaus standard were further commercialised during and following the European Union sponsored CEPHEUS project, which proved the concept in five European countries in the winter of 2000\\u20132001.

Since then, thousands of Passivhaus structures have been built, to an estimated 25,000+ as of 2010. Most are located in Germany and Austria, with others in various countries worldwide.

Tariff for solar thermal projects is fixed Rs. 15.40 (USD 0.342/kWh). Tariff will be reviewed periodically by the CERC. In 2015, the feed in tariff is about Rs. 7.50 (USD 0.125)/kWh and is mostly applicable at utility level. The feed-in tariff for roof top PV plants is still not applicable. The Indonesian government, operating mainly through the State Electricity Corporation (\\\"\\\"Perusahaan Listrik Negara, or PLN\\\"\\\"), encouraged independent power producers (IPPs) to invest in the electric power sector. Numerous IPPs are investing in large plants (over 500 MW)\\n---\\n\\\"Solar Resource\\\"\\nbackyard project, headed by Ian Landon Smith, an engineer and alternative energy specialist during 1986-7. During that time, each component of the Solar Resource was made and re-made 3 times prior to a successful final construction. While the cost of building the car was approximately $75,000, almost $1 million on the 760 gallium-arsenide solar cells, usually used on space satellites. The dimensions of the Solar Resource include a height of 1.04 metres, a width of 2 metres and a depth of 5.43 metres, with a total weight of 170 kg.

It is a collaboration of private companies, universities, state and local governments, and nonprofits, as well as national laboratories. The program began in 2011 with the initial goal of making solar energy competitive with traditional forms of electricity by 2020. By 2016, the program achieved 70% of the progress towards the 2020 goal. In the fiscal year 2012 Congressional budget, the program was appropriated $457 million.

In 2013, the Clinton Foundation provided a grant to Papillon Enterprise. The grant covered a building, more Haitian staff, and supplies. Through a Clinton Foundation investment, Papillion Enterprise was able to purchase kilns and other resources that allowed them to produce clay beads and other ceramic products. The kilns require significant energy and were increasing costs, so through a partnership they were able to provide a roof-top solar system to power them, and most of the operations, with\\n---\\n\\\"Solar Total Energy Project\\\"\\nOlympic Games.
