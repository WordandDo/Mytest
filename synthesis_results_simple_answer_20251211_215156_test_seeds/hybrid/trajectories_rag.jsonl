During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky. Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical\\n---\\n\\\"Temporal annotation\\\"\\nTemporal annotation Temporal annotation is the study of how to automatically add semantic information regarding time to natural language documents. It plays a role in natural language processing and computational linguistics. Temporal annotation involves the application of a semantic annotation to a document. Significant temporal annotation standards include TimeML, ISO-TimeML and TIDES. These standards typically include annotations for some or all of temporal expressions (or \\\"\\\"timexes\\\"\\\"), events, temporal relations, temporal signals, and temporal relation types. In natural language texts, events may be associated with times; e.g., they may start or end at a given at a time.

There is some overlap with the history of machine translation and the history of artificial intelligence. The history of machine translation dates back to the seventeenth century, when philosophers such as Leibniz and Descartes put forward proposals for codes which would relate words between languages. All of these proposals remained theoretical, and none resulted in the development of an actual machine. The first patents for \\\"\\\"translating machines\\\"\\\" were applied for in the mid-1930s.

During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky. Up to the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing.

QA systems have been extended in recent years to encompass additional domains of knowledge For example,\\n---\\n\\\"Natural language processing\\\"\\nnatural language tasks, for example in language modeling, parsing, and many others. Popular techniques include the use of word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words, and an increase in end-to-end learning of a higher-level task (e.g., question answering) instead of relying on a pipeline of separate intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing). In some areas, this shift has entailed substantial changes in how NLP systems are designed, such that deep neural network-based approaches may be viewed as a new paradigm distinct from statistical natural language processing. For instance, the term \\\"\\\"neural machine translation\\\"\\\" (NMT) emphasizes the fact\\n---\\n\\\"Natural language processing\\\"\\nis much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical. In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing, due in part to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many\\n---\\n\\\"History of natural language processing\\\"\\ninput. Instead of \\\"\\\"phrase structure rules\\\"\\\" ATNs used an equivalent set of finite state automata that were called recursively. ATNs and their more general format called \\\"\\\"generalized ATNs\\\"\\\" continued to be used for a number of years.During the 70's many programmers began to write 'conceptual ontologies', which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981).

Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based on pattern matching techniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.

In 1950, Alan Turing's famous article \\\"\\\"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\\\"\\\" was published, which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably\\u2014on the basis of the conversational content alone\\u2014between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to\\n---\\nChatbot\\n(Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities. In 1984, a book called \\\"\\\"The Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed\\\"\\\" was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so). One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup language called AIML,\\n---\\nChatbot\\nthe program in question from the shelf marked \\\"\\\"intelligent\\\"\\\", to that reserved for curios ...

ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of cue words or phrases in the input, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').\"}", "intent": "Retrieve exact details about the ELIZA chatbot milestone (year, creator) using keyword search to ensure precise information", "action": {"tool_name": "query_knowledge_base_sparse", "parameters": {"query": "ELIZA chatbot 1966", "top_k": "5", "worker_id": "worker-8"}}, "parent_id": "d3_t22_b0", "children_ids": ["d5_t24_b0"], "depth": 4}, {"node_id": "d5_t24_b0", "observation": "{\"status\": \"success\", \"results\": \"\\\"Natural language processing\\\"\\nNatural language processing Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum created a program which appeared to pass the Turing test. The program, known as ELIZA, worked by examining a user's typed comments for keywords. If a keyword is found, a rule that transforms the user's comments is applied, and the resulting sentence is returned. If a keyword is not found, ELIZA responds either with a generic riposte or by repeating one of the earlier comments.

In PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority node) uncompromised. The term was coined by Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum and Parity Technologies. With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an\\n---\\nDecred\\nProof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain consensus protocol. Both Proof-of Work and Proof-of-Stake mechanisms are used to provide the consensus that confirms new blocks including transactions.

Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNight, Blake, SHA-3, and X11. The proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it.

In PoS-based cryptocurrencies the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection and wealth or age (\\\"\\\"i.e.,\\\"\\\" the stake). In contrast, the algorithm of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin uses mining; that is, the solving of computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.

In this system, transactions between users (such as sending and receiving cryptocurrency) are broadcast to every node in the network. However, before the transaction is recorded as a block on the blockchain, nodes must ensure that a transaction is valid. In other words, nodes must check past transactions of the spender to ensure that he/she did not double spend, or spend more funds than they actually own. After nodes confirm that a block is valid, consensus protocols, such as proof of work and proof of stake, are then deployed by miners.

The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there's currently no standard form of it.

The purpose is to reduce the [[file size]] of torrent files, which reduces the burden on those that serve torrent files. A torrent file using Merkle trees does not have a pieces key in the info list.
