    "predicted_answer": "Reverse image search did not yield relevant results about the computer program or the institution where it was developed. However, the image itself resembles molecular modeling visualizations, commonly produced by programs like PyMOL or Chimera, which are often associated with research institutions.\n\nTo answer your question accurately, could you specify the name of the program used to generate the image? This will help identify the institution and its founding year. If you are unsure, I can attempt to identify the program based on the image style using a follow-up search. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed!",
