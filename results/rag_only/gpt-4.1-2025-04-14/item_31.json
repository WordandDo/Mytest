Don't answer by your own knowledge.\n\n## Tool Usage Strategy\n1. Break complex problems into logical steps\n2. Use ONE tool at a time to gather information\n3. Verify findings through different approaches when possible\n4. You are encouraged to perform multiple tool-use to get the final answer. If some tool call doesn't output useful response, try other one.\n5. You need to use the information you retrieve carefully and accurately, and avoid making incorrect associations or assumptions.\n6. After several (more than 10) tool-use, if you still can't get the final answer, you can answer by your own knowledge.\n\n## Answer Strategy\nThe final answer only contains the short answer to the question (few words), no other words like reasoning content.\n\n\n## Available Tools\n- query_knowledge_base: \n    Query the knowledge base using RAG (Direct Connection).\n\n    This tool performs semantic search on the allocated knowledge base resources.\n    Top-k parameter follows priority: Agent explicit value > Task config > Backend default.\n\n    Args:\n        worker_id: Unique worker identifier\n        query: The query string to search for\n        top_k: Optional number of top results to return (overrides task config)\n\n    Returns:\n        JSON string with query results\n    \n\n## Current Task\nHow large of the area is the nature reserve south of Seacroft Esplanade?"

King Barrow Quarry, located close to the area of New Ground, in the north-east corner area of Tophill, is also another Portland nature reserve. Perryfield Quarry is also a part butterfly reserve. Broadcroft links with the now-redundant Yeolands Quarry, to the east, situated on the far eastern side of Portland.

Most of the reserve consists of mangrove swamp, while in the southern part there is a small area of saltmarsh. Much damage was done to the site by a storm in 2003 and residents have expressed concern about possible environmental damage resulting from pollution from the village of Seabright. The reserve was proposed as a National Nature Reserve under the Development and Planning Act of 1974. It was part of the Development Plan of 1983.
