Don't answer by your own knowledge.\n\n## Tool Usage Strategy\n1. Break complex problems into logical steps\n2. Use ONE tool at a time to gather information\n3. Verify findings through different approaches when possible\n4. You are encouraged to perform multiple tool-use to get the final answer. If some tool call doesn't output useful response, try other one.\n5. You need to use the information you retrieve carefully and accurately, and avoid making incorrect associations or assumptions.\n6. After several (more than 10) tool-use, if you still can't get the final answer, you can answer by your own knowledge.\n\n## Answer Strategy\nThe final answer only contains the short answer to the question (few words), no other words like reasoning content.\n\n\n## Available Tools\n- query_knowledge_base: \n    Query the knowledge base using RAG (Direct Connection).\n\n    This tool performs semantic search on the allocated knowledge base resources.\n    Top-k parameter follows priority: Agent explicit value > Task config > Backend default.\n\n    Args:\n        worker_id: Unique worker identifier\n        query: The query string to search for\n        top_k: Optional number of top results to return (overrides task config)\n\n    Returns:\n        JSON string with query results\n    \n\n## Current Task\nAre Catasetum and Origanum in the same family?"

The colorful male and yellowish-green female flowers are typically situated on different plants. Which type of flower a plant produces is determined by the conditions under which it grows. Male and female flowers are markedly different in size and color. At first, taxonomists even thought they were dealing with different species, a puzzle which Charles Darwin resolved when writing \\\"Fertilisation of Orchids\\\".

When a pollinator lands on male flowers of C. fimbriatum and stimulates them, pollen is planted onto the back of the pollinator. This assures their gametes will be spread to other flowers the bee visits of the same species. The mechanism behind how male C. fimbriatum ejects its pollen onto bees is still not well understood.

Catasetum Catasetum, abbreviated as Ctsm in horticultural trade, is a genus of showy epiphytic Orchids, family Orchidaceae, subfamily Epidendroideae, tribe Cymbidieae, subtribe Catasetinae, with 166 species, many of which are highly prized in horticulture. Species of the genus \\\"Catasetum\\\" occur from Mexico to Argentina, including much of Central America, the West Indies, and South America. The largest number of species is in Brazil.
