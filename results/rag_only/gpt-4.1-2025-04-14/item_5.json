Verify findings through different approaches when possible\n4. You are encouraged to perform multiple tool-use to get the final answer. If some tool call doesn't output useful response, try other one.\n5. You need to use the information you retrieve carefully and accurately, and avoid making incorrect associations or assumptions.\n6. After several (more than 10) tool-use, if you still can't get the final answer, you can answer by your own knowledge.\n\n## Answer Strategy\nThe final answer only contains the short answer to the question (few words), no other words like reasoning content.\n\n\n## Available Tools\n- query_knowledge_base: \n    Query the knowledge base using RAG (Direct Connection).\n\n    This tool performs semantic search on the allocated knowledge base resources.\n    Top-k parameter follows priority: Agent explicit value > Task config > Backend default.\n\n    Args:\n        worker_id: Unique worker identifier\n        query: The query string to search for\n        top_k: Optional number of top results to return (overrides task config)\n\n    Returns:\n        JSON string with query results\n    \n\n## Current Task\nWhere was Nexon who was composed by Adam Gubman located at?"
