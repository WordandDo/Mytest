I mean if you look at Christ, He was hanging around with the lowlifes, prostitutes and the losers you know, not going around with those high society motherfuckers you see trying to sell Jesus today! When asked in an interview whether he was a Christian and whether Soulfly was a Christian band, he said: No. I mean, if I was a Christian I would wear all these different kinds\\n---\\n[Soulfly (album)]\\nbeing heavy. Part of the magic was working with some of my all-time favourite Brazilian musicians and that really pushed me to write some great and some very different sounding music. Eye For an Eye is still my favourite, man, and I also like Tribe. That's like an anthem for all metalheads. Soulfly (album) Soulfly is the self-titled debut album by the metal band Soulfly, released on April 21, 1998 through Roadrunner Records. The record was released in memory of frontman Max Cavalera's murdered stepson and the first album featuring Cavalera since leaving Sepultura two years prior. Both CDs have\\n---\\n[Max Cavalera]\\nof omens. Because Christian people are so close-minded. A priest would not accept that. So I don't like the concept of Christianity in terms of being so close-minded. It is the same with music. Sometimes I compare preachers to close-minded musicians or close-minded listeners, who only like one kind of music. Some preachers are the same. And they don't tolerate Hindus, Buddhists or whatever. Only them. It's bullshit. So Soulfly is not a Christian band at all. Very much opposite. But we are very spiritual. Spiritual has nothing to do with Christianity anyway.

In 2008, speaking to \\\"Kerrang!\\\", Max Cavalera remembered:It was so hard to start over, having been in Sepultura for so long. In fact, it was harder getting Soulfly going than it was getting Sepultura started. Coming into a whole new situation underneath the shadow of \\\"Roots\\\" was a huge challenge for me, and most people thought I was nuts. Plus, we made a conscious effort not to sound like Sepultura.

There are two bassists playing as members of Soulfly on \\\"Prophecy\\\" \\u2013 David Ellefson of Megadeth and Bobby Burns of Primer 55. Cavalera took this decision to have a mixture of old school metal and death metal on the album. Max Cavalera explains on Roadrunner Records website that he wants to use different musicians as part of the group for each album. \\\"\\\"This is an approach that I've wanted to do for a while. I never wanted Soulfly to be a band like Metallica, with the same four guys. On every Soulfly album, we've changed the line-up and\"}"
