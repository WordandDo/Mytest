Director John Gallagher, who worked with Vincent on \\\"Street Hunter\\\" and \\\"The Deli\\\", noted that the actor lied about his age to avoid discrimination, and therefore many sources listed his birth year as 1939. Vincent's remains were cremated at a funeral home in Montclair, New Jersey. A funeral service was held on September 16. Frank Vincent Frank Vincent Gattuso Jr. (April 15, 1937 \\u2013 September 13, 2017), known professionally as Frank Vincent, was an American actor. He played prominent roles in the HBO series \\\"The Sopranos\\\" and in several films for director Martin Scorsese: \\\"Raging Bull\\\" (1980), \\\"Goodfellas\\\"\\n---\\n[Frank Vincent]\\nhad a leading role in the heist movie \\\"This Thing of Ours\\\" (2003), wherein he had a brief association with alleged Genovese crime family capo Danny Provenzano (grandnephew of Anthony Provenzano) and Colombo crime family underboss Sonny Franzese, who is arguably the oldest American Mafia member and is alleged to have murdered around 50 people; Vincent is pictured with them alongside former Sopranos actors including Vincent Pastore. In 2003, Vincent testified in court twice on behalf of Provenzano at repeal sentences; Provenzano was serving a 10-year sentence for racketeering and other charges. One of Vincent's lighter-hearted roles was in a\\n---\\n[Frank Vincent]\\n(1989) and \\\"Jungle Fever\\\" (1991) (in the latter, he played the abusive patriarch of an Italian family). One of his notable appearances in foreign film was in Juan Jos\\u00e9 Jusid's \\\"Made in Argentina\\\", in which he played Vito, a wealthy Manhattan businessman who befriends the substance abuse counselor who treated his son. Vincent was often cast as a gangster. For example, in Scorsese's film \\\"Goodfellas\\\" (1990), he played Billy Batts, a made man in the Gambino crime family; he also played a role in Scorsese's film \\\"Casino\\\" (1995) as Frank Marino (based on real-life gangster Frank Cullotta), the sidekick of\\n---\\n[Jan-Michael Vincent]\\nWayne, Rock Hudson, and Antonio Aguilar. His name appeared as Michael Vincent in the credits of the movie. Vincent guest-starred in three episodes of \\\"Lassie\\\" with actor Tony Dow and two episodes of \\\"Bonanza\\\". In 1970, Vincent garnered critical praise for his role in the made-for-TV film \\\"Tribes\\\" (also known as \\\"The Soldier Who Declared Peace\\\" in Europe and the UK), co-starring Darren McGavin, about a tough Marine boot-camp drill instructor dealing with a hippie draftee (Vincent) who will not follow the rules. He gave a complex performance opposite Robert Mitchum in \\\"Going Home\\\" ('71). That same year, he appeared\\n---\\n[Vincent Corleone]\\nand Vito's first meeting with Hyman Roth. According to Coppola, Puzo had composed a rough draft alternating between Vincent's reign as boss and the \\\"Happy Years\\\" of 1926\\u20131939; passages from the original novel not previously incorporated into the movie storylines. Leonardo DiCaprio, Luis Guzm\\u00e1n, Ray Liotta, and Garc\\u00eda himself all expressed interest in the film. However, this project has lain dormant since Puzo's death in 1999. Vincent Corleone Vincent Santino Corleone (n\\u00e9 Mancini) is a fictional character in the 1990 feature film \\\"The Godfather Part III\\\", in which he is portrayed by Andy Garc\\u00eda, who was nominated for an Academy\"}"
