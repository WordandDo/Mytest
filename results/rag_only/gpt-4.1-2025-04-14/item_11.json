CLO is a member of the North American Students of Cooperation. Cooperative Living Organization Cooperative Living Organization (CLO), formerly Collegiate Living Organization, in Gainesville, Florida, is one of the oldest continuously operating independent student-governed cooperative living organizations in the United States. The 80-year-old organization has provided over 2000 financially disadvantaged students an opportunity for a University of Florida education while providing experience in independent and socially responsible living by pooled resources and self-governance. CLO began in the depression year of 1931 with four Tallahassee, Florida boys who pooled their meager resources in order to remain enrolled in the\\n---\\n[Cooperative Living Organization]\\nseize control of the property by shutting down CLO operations.

The move caused an international response from CLO alumni, friends and families of graduates facilitated by internet communication in solidarity with current members of the organization. This response resulted in a court-mediated agreement between the University of Florida and CLO\\n---\\n[Cooperative Living Organization]\\nnon-discrimination policy. In 1968 the organization was the first off campus living organization including social fraternities and sororities at the University of Florida campus to accept African-American students. Under the leadership of CLO alumni Frank Shepherd, architect Jack Turner and enthusiastic support of the University of Florida President and administration, a successful movement to acquire funds through a HUD loan for new buildings resulted in replacement of the wood and brick houses historically referred to as the \\\"Brown House,\\\" \\\"White House,\\\" \\\"Brick House,\\\" and \\\"Chow Hall\\\" with modern concrete buildings with capacity for up to 80 residents.
